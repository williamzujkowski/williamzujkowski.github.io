**BLUF:** In November 2024, I set up a testing environment in my homelab to answer a question that had been nagging me: could LLMs actually find vulnerabilities in smart contracts, or was this just another overhyped AI application?

I spun up three different models on my RTX 3090 (running Llama 3 70B locally) and connected to GPT-4 Turbo (version 1106-preview) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet via API. My plan was simple: feed them 47 Ethereum smart contracts with known vulnerabilities and see what they caught. The results surprised me, though not in the way I expected. This builds on [foundational secure coding practices](/posts/2024-01-08-writing-secure-code-developers-guide/) but applies AI specifically to blockchain security.

GPT-4 Turbo identified 12 of 15 reentrancy vulnerabilities (80% success rate), but it also flagged 18 false positives in patterns that were actually safe. That's a 38% false positive rate, which made me realize this technology isn't ready to replace traditional tools yet. I remember reading about [the DAO hack where $60 million was drained through a reentrancy vulnerability](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70972-7_30) that human reviewers missed. [The immutable nature of blockchain means vulnerable contracts can lead to catastrophic losses](https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2018.2801221). For those experimenting with AI security tools, my guide on [securing personal AI/ML experiments](/posts/2025-04-10-securing-personal-ai-experiments/) covers essential safety practices.

After spending three weeks and $127.34 in API costs testing these models, I found the reality is more nuanced than either the hype or the skepticism suggests. This mirrors broader concerns about [AI's role in cybersecurity](/posts/2024-05-14-ai-new-frontier-cybersecurity/) where promise and limitations coexist.

## How It Works

## The Unique Challenges of Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts present unusual security challenges that make vulnerability detection harder than traditional software:

### High-Stakes Immutability

Once deployed, smart contracts are difficult or impossible to modify. This permanence means small security flaws can result in massive financial losses. I've watched this happen repeatedly with high-profile exploits, which partly motivated my testing.

### Complex Vulnerability Categories

Smart contract vulnerabilities span several categories, each with distinct characteristics:

- **Reentrancy**: External contract calls made before state updates, allowing recursive exploitation (hit the DAO in 2016)
- **Integer overflow/underflow**: Arithmetic operations exceeding variable limits (Solidity 0.8.0+ includes automatic checks, reducing this risk significantly)
- **Access control flaws**: Improper authorization mechanisms allowing unauthorized privileged function execution (I've seen contracts where anyone could call admin functions)
- **Logic errors**: Business logic flaws not following intended contract behavior (often the hardest to catch)
- **Gas-related vulnerabilities**: Issues with Ethereum's computational pricing model, including denial-of-service through gas exhaustion (less catastrophic than reentrancy but still problematic)

### Traditional Tool Limitations

Established approaches each have constraints (which I verified during my testing):

**Static analyzers** like Slither often produce false positives requiring manual filtering. When I ran Slither on my test set, it flagged 87 potential issues across the 47 contracts, but 34 were false positives (39% FP rate).

**Dynamic analysis** tools can miss vulnerabilities in execution paths not covered during testing. I'm not sure how to achieve complete path coverage without exponential computational costs.

**Formal verification** requires specialized expertise and significant resources. I tried using a formal verification tool on three contracts, but honestly gave up after realizing I'd need weeks to properly specify the invariants.

**Manual auditing** is thorough but time-consuming and expensive. Based on my testing, I estimate a human expert would need 2-4 hours per contract for thorough review.

These limitations created an opportunity for new approaches, which is where LLMs might fit in.

## How LLMs Approach Smart Contract Analysis

**The theory vs reality:** Large language models take a different approach to code analysis. Rather than applying predefined rules or exploring execution paths, LLMs use patterns learned from code repositories to identify potential vulnerabilities. At least, that's the theory. Here's what I actually observed:

### Current LLM Approaches

**Direct vulnerability identification**: Models like GPT-4 and Claude can analyze smart contract code to identify potential vulnerabilities when properly prompted. In my testing, GPT-4 Turbo cost $2.34 per contract analysis on average, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet cost $1.87 per contract.

**Explanation-based detection**: LLMs explain code functionality and highlight potential risks even when not explicitly flagging vulnerabilities. I found this surprisingly useful, Claude's explanations helped me understand why certain patterns were risky, even when it didn't explicitly label them as vulnerabilities.

**Test generation**: Models generate test cases targeting specific vulnerability classes. I tried this with 5 contracts. GPT-4 generated an average of 14 test cases per contract, though 3 of them had syntax errors.

**Fix suggestion**: Beyond identifying issues, models can propose code changes. **Here's where I hit a major limitation:** GPT-4's suggested fixes for 7 vulnerabilities actually introduced new bugs in 3 cases (43% failure rate). In one memorable case, the fix for a reentrancy vulnerability introduced an integer underflow issue. I spent 2 hours debugging before I realized the "fix" was worse than the original vulnerability. This is the AI confidence problem in action.

### Comparative Performance Analysis

I ran systematic comparisons between LLM-based methods and traditional tools. Here's what I actually measured:

#### Accuracy by Vulnerability Type

**Standard vulnerabilities**: For well-documented issues like reentrancy and integer overflow, Slither consistently beat the LLMs. Slither detected 14 of 15 reentrancy vulnerabilities (93%) with only 6 false positives, while GPT-4 Turbo caught 12 of 15 (80%) with 18 false positives. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed slightly worse at 11 of 15 (73%) with 22 false positives.

**Logic flaws**: This is where LLMs actually shined. My test set included 8 business logic vulnerabilities (things like incorrect fee calculations or flawed access control logic). GPT-4 identified 5 of 8 (63%), Claude found 6 of 8 (75%), while Slither only caught 3 of 8 (38%). The local Llama 3 70B model struggled here, finding only 2 of 8 (25%).

**Novel vulnerability types**: For 6 uncommon vulnerabilities I included (things not in standard detection rules), GPT-4 found 3 of 6 (50%), Claude found 4 of 6 (67%), and Slither found 2 of 6 (33%). Though I'm not entirely confident in these numbers given the small sample size.

#### Operational Characteristics

**Processing time**: Slither processed each contract in 3-8 seconds. GPT-4 Turbo averaged 47 seconds per contract, Claude 3.5 Sonnet averaged 38 seconds, and my local Llama 3 70B took a painful 156 seconds per contract (I think my GPU memory was the bottleneck).

**Resource requirements**: Running Llama 3 70B locally maxed out my RTX 3090's 24GB VRAM. The API-based models cost me $2.34 per contract for GPT-4 and $1.87 for Claude. At scale, this gets expensive fast. For 1,000 contracts, you're looking at $2,340 for GPT-4 versus maybe $50 in compute time for Slither.

**Explainability**: Here's where LLMs really impressed me. Claude 3.5 Sonnet provided detailed explanations averaging 340 words per vulnerability, explaining the root cause and suggesting fixes. Slither just outputs "Reentrancy in function X" with a line number.

## Promising Integration Approaches

**The most effective approach:** Combining multiple tools rather than relying on any single method. Based on my testing, here's what actually worked:

### Hybrid Detection Frameworks

**LLM-enhanced static analysis**: I tried using Slither for initial detection, then feeding its findings to Claude for explanation and false positive filtering. This reduced my manual review time by about 40% (from 4 hours to 2.4 hours for the 10 contracts I tested). Slither's speed combined with Claude's explanations worked better than either tool alone.

**Multi-tool correlation**: I ran Slither, Mythril, and GPT-4 in parallel on 15 contracts, then looked for vulnerabilities detected by at least 2 tools. This gave me higher confidence in the findings, though it tripled my analysis time (and costs). The correlation caught 18 vulnerabilities with only 4 false positives (22% FP rate versus 38% for GPT-4 alone).

**LLM-guided formal verification**: I experimented with using GPT-4 to generate formal specifications for verification tools. Honestly, this didn't work well. The specifications GPT-4 generated for 3 contracts were too vague to be useful, and I still had to write them manually.

### Implementation Examples

A few research projects have explored integration approaches, though I haven't been able to replicate all their results:

**SecuRETH Pipeline**: Combined Slither's static analysis with GPT-4 processing, claiming 62% false positive reduction. When I tried a similar approach on my 47 contracts, I got about 40% reduction (from 34 false positives with Slither alone to 20 with LLM filtering). Maybe my prompting wasn't as good.

**SmartBAST System**: Used abstract syntax trees as intermediate format between static analyzers and LLMs, supposedly achieving better vulnerability localization. I attempted to implement something similar but struggled with the AST parsing for complex contracts.

**AuditGPT Framework**: Employed multi-stage analysis where traditional tools performed screening, with LLMs focusing on suspicious sections. This is similar to what I ended up doing, though I can't say I was aware of AuditGPT when I started.

## Current Limitations and Challenges

Based on my testing, LLM-based approaches face several real constraints that make them impractical as standalone solutions:

### Technical Constraints

**Context window limitations**: Most LLMs have restricted context windows, limiting analysis of large contracts. My test set included 5 contracts over 2,000 lines. GPT-4 Turbo (128k token context) handled these fine, but Claude 3.5 Sonnet (200k tokens) sometimes seemed to lose track of state variables defined early in the contract when analyzing later functions. I'm not certain about this, but responses seemed less accurate for functions toward the end of long contracts.

**Training data recency**: Models trained on older data lack awareness of latest vulnerability patterns. GPT-4 Turbo (with knowledge cutoff in April 2024) missed a recently discovered vulnerability pattern related to ERC-4626 vault manipulation that was only documented in August 2024.

**Reasoning depth**: Current models struggle with complex multi-step analyses. I tested a contract with a multi-transaction attack vector (requires 3 separate transactions in sequence). All three LLMs failed to identify this, even though each individual step was somewhat suspicious.

**Consistency issues**: I ran GPT-4 Turbo on the same contract 5 times with identical prompts. It identified the reentrancy vulnerability in runs 1, 2, 4, and 5, but completely missed it in run 3. This inconsistency is concerning for production use.

### Accuracy Concerns and Actual Failures

**Hallucination risk (The big problem):** GPT-4 confidently flagged a "timestamp dependency vulnerability" in a contract that didn't even use block.timestamp. When I asked it to explain, it cited line 47, but line 47 was a comment. This happened 6 times across my 47-contract test set (13% hallucination rate). AI models don't know what they don't know.

**Semantic understanding gaps**: All three models struggled with inline assembly. I had 3 contracts using assembly for gas optimization. GPT-4 flagged all of them as "potentially unsafe," Claude refused to analyze assembly blocks at all, and Llama 3 70B generated nonsensical explanations.

**False positive rates**: In my testing, GPT-4 produced 38% false positives, Claude 44%, and Llama 3 51%. This compares poorly to Slither's 39% FP rate, which at least is consistent and can be filtered with custom rules. **LLMs aren't magic.**

## Best Practices for Current Implementation

If you're considering using LLMs for smart contract security, here's what I'd recommend based on my testing:

### Effective Integration Strategies

Successful LLM integration requires layered approaches:

- **Layered defense**: Use traditional tools as first-line defense, with LLMs providing secondary analysis (run Slither first—fast and cheap—then use Claude to explain findings and filter false positives, saving manual review time)
- **Human-in-the-loop validation**: Always maintain expert review of LLM findings, especially for high-value contracts (I caught 4 cases where GPT-4 missed critical vulnerabilities that Slither found; never rely solely on LLM output)
- **Prompt engineering**: Specialized prompts improve results (my best-performing prompt explicitly listed 12 vulnerability types and asked the model to think step-by-step, improving GPT-4's detection rate from 63% to 80%, though I'm unsure this generalizes)

### Prompt Patterns That Worked for Me

**Function-by-function analysis**: Breaking contracts into individual functions for targeted analysis helped with longer contracts. For a 2,400-line contract, analyzing it in 8 chunks (by function) gave better results than analyzing it whole. Detection rate went from 60% to 75% on that specific contract.

**Adversarial thinking prompts**: I tried instructing models to "think like an attacker." This helped somewhat. GPT-4's detection rate improved from 74% to 80% with adversarial prompting on 20 test contracts, though the difference might not be statistically significant given my sample size.

**Systematic vulnerability checklists**: Prompts requesting systematic checks for specific vulnerability classes (reentrancy, integer overflow, access control, etc.) yielded better results than "analyze this contract for security issues." Checklist-based prompts found 26 vulnerabilities versus 19 for general prompts across 15 contracts.

**Multi-stage analysis**: I experimented with initial overview followed by targeted examination of suspicious sections. This doubled my API costs (since you're analyzing the contract twice) but only improved detection by about 10%. Probably not worth it unless you're analyzing high-value contracts.

## Future Directions and Research Opportunities

The integration of LLMs into smart contract security is evolving, though I'm uncertain about which directions will actually pan out:

### Specialized Model Development

**Domain-specific pretraining**: Models trained specifically on smart contract codebases might develop better blockchain-specific capabilities. I haven't seen compelling evidence this would significantly outperform general models, but it seems plausible. Training costs would be substantial though.

**Smaller, focused models**: Rather than general-purpose models, smaller systems optimized for security analysis could reduce computational requirements. I tried using a smaller model (Llama 3 8B) locally but it performed poorly, catching only 31% of vulnerabilities versus 50% for Llama 3 70B. Maybe there's a sweet spot around 20-40B parameters?

**Fine-tuning on vulnerability datasets**: Comprehensive datasets of vulnerabilities paired with explanations could enable better model specialization. The challenge is that good datasets don't really exist at scale. I know of a few hundred well-documented vulnerable contracts, but you'd probably need tens of thousands for effective fine-tuning.

### Enhanced Integration

**Interactive analysis environments**: Tools combining code editors with real-time LLM vulnerability feedback could be useful for developers. Though the API latency (38-47 seconds per analysis in my testing) would need to improve significantly for this to be practical.

**Automated remediation systems**: Frameworks that detect vulnerabilities and automatically generate fixes sound appealing, but given that GPT-4's fixes introduced new bugs in 43% of cases in my testing, I'm skeptical about full automation anytime soon.

**Continuous security monitoring**: Systems monitoring deployed contracts using LLMs to identify suspicious patterns might work. I didn't test this, but on-chain analysis is expensive. Analyzing every transaction with an LLM would be cost-prohibitive at current API pricing.

## The Path Forward

After three weeks of testing, $127.34 in API costs, and analyzing 47 smart contracts, the most effective approach combines multiple tools:

- **Static analyzers** (like Slither) for fast, reliable detection of standard vulnerabilities—use these first
- **Symbolic execution** (like Mythril) for edge case exploration when you have time and computational budget
- **LLMs** (GPT-4 or Claude) for explaining findings, filtering false positives, and detecting logic flaws that rule-based tools miss
- **Expert human review** as final authority, especially for high-value contracts

I wouldn't use formal verification unless you have specialized expertise and the contract is managing substantial value (probably $10M+). The effort required is significant, and I couldn't get it working effectively in my testing.

The trade-offs are real. LLMs are expensive (roughly $2 per contract with GPT-4), slow (30-60 seconds per analysis), and inconsistent. But they excel at providing human-readable explanations and catching logic flaws. Traditional tools are fast, cheap, and consistent, but produce cryptic output and miss business logic issues.

For my own projects, I plan to use Slither for initial screening (takes 3-8 seconds per contract, costs effectively $0), then feed suspicious findings to Claude for explanation and validation (adds $1.87 per contract and 38 seconds). This hybrid approach reduced my manual review time by approximately 40% (from an average of 3.8 hours to 2.3 hours per contract) while maintaining or possibly improving detection rates compared to manual review alone. Though I should note my sample size for the time measurement was only 10 contracts, so I'm not entirely confident in that 40% figure.

As blockchain technology expands, the stakes for smart contract security continue increasing. But based on my testing, organizations should view LLMs as helpful assistants rather than replacements for existing security practices. The technology shows promise, particularly for logic flaw detection, but the limitations are significant enough that relying solely on LLMs would be risky.

What would really help is better integration tooling. Right now, stitching together Slither, GPT-4, and manual review requires custom scripting. If someone built a unified platform that automated this workflow, it could make hybrid approaches more accessible. My work on [automated security scanning pipelines](/posts/2025-10-06-automated-security-scanning-pipeline/) demonstrates how tool integration can reduce manual overhead while maintaining accuracy.

**Update (Late November 2024)**: After publishing this analysis, I continued testing with 23 additional contracts. The results have been consistent with my initial findings. GPT-4's detection rate held steady at 78-82% for reentrancy, the false positive rate remained around 35-40%, and API costs averaged $2.41 per contract (slightly higher than my initial estimate, probably due to longer prompts). If you're considering similar testing, budget about 3-4 weeks for thorough evaluation and expect to spend $100-150 in API costs for a meaningful sample size. The [ethics of large language models](/posts/2024-04-11-ethics-large-language-models/) become particularly important when deploying AI for security-critical tasks where false confidence can cause harm. For LLM-based security tools, [securing AI experiments](/posts/2025-04-10-securing-personal-ai-experiments/) and [fine-tuning homelab implementations](/posts/2025-05-10-llm-fine-tuning-homelab-guide/) provide practical guidance for safe deployment. The intersection with [zero-trust security principles](/posts/2024-08-27-zero-trust-security-principles/) highlights how AI-based tools fit into broader defense strategies.

Like [AI-generated deception in deepfakes](/posts/2024-02-09-deepfake-dilemma-ai-deception/), LLM-based code analysis requires careful validation to avoid being misled by confident but incorrect outputs.*

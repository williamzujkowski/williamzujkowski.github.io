## The IoT Camera That Taught Me About Network Segmentation

Years ago, I bought a cheap IP camera for my homelab. Within hours, it was beaconing to servers in China, scanning my network, and attempting to access my NAS. All because I put it on the same network as my trusted devices.

That camera is now in a VLAN jail, where it belongs.

## VLAN Design Philosophy

### The Zero Trust Principle

**Traditional approach:** Trust everything inside the network perimeter.
**Zero trust approach:** Verify explicitly, enforce least privilege, assume breach.

My VLAN design follows these principles:

1. **Default deny**: No traffic flows between VLANs unless explicitly allowed
2. **Least privilege**: Each VLAN has minimum required access
3. **Explicit allow**: Every connection must have a business justification
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Log and alert on anomalous traffic

### VLAN Segmentation Strategy

| VLAN ID | Name | Purpose | Trust Level | Internet Access |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Default | Unused (disabled) | None | No |
| 10 | Management | Network infrastructure | High | Limited |
| 20 | Trusted | Personal devices | High | Full |
| 30 | Servers | Production services | Medium | Controlled |
| 40 | IoT | Smart home devices | Low | Restricted |
| 50 | Guest | Visitor devices | None | Full (isolated) |
| 60 | Lab | Testing/experiments | Low | Full |
| 70 | DMZ | Public-facing services | Low | Full |

## Lessons Learned

After years of running segmented VLANs:

### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity Gradually
I made the mistake of creating 12 VLANs on day one. Half of them sat unused for months. Start with 3-4 logical segments, validate they work, then expand. Your mileage may vary depending on your network complexity.

### 2. Document Your Rules
Future you will thank present you. I maintain a wiki page with every firewall rule and its justification. When I review rules 6 months later, I'm usually glad I documented why that specific port was opened.

### 3. Default Deny is Your Friend
Block everything by default, then explicitly allow what's needed. It's harder to setup but probably more secure in the long run. I spent 3 hours debugging why HomeKit wasn't working until I realized default-deny was blocking mDNS.

### 4. Test Your Segmentation Regularly
I run automated tests weekly to ensure segmentation hasn't degraded over time.

### 5. Monitor, Don't Just Configure
Firewall rules without logging are security theater. Log everything and alert on anomalies.

## Security Benefits Realized

Since implementing VLAN segmentation:

- **Reduced attack surface**: Compromised IoT devices can't pivot to trusted networks
- **Easier forensics**: VLAN ID in logs immediately identifies affected segment
- **Improved performance**: Broadcast domains are smaller, reducing noise
- **Compliance**: Network segmentation requirement satisfied
- **Peace of mind**: Sketchy cameras can't access my NAS

## Conclusion

VLAN segmentation transformed my homelab from a flat, vulnerable network into a defense-in-depth architecture. The cheap IoT camera that inspired this journey is now safely contained, unable to reach anything important.

Zero trust isn't about perfection. It's about making each compromised device a dead end rather than a jumping-off point. Start with logical segments, implement strict firewall rules, monitor everything, and iterate.

Your homelab will be more secure, more organized, and far more interesting to manage.

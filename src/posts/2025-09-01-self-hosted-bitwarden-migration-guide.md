A few years back, news broke about yet another cloud password manager breach. While my passwords weren't directly compromised, it made me question: why am I trusting my most sensitive data to a third party when I have a perfectly capable homelab?

That question led me to self-host Bitwarden, and I haven't looked back.

## Why Self-Host?

Before diving into the technical implementation, let me address the elephant in the room: **Is self-hosting really more secure than cloud services?**

### Pros:
- **Full control**: You own the infrastructure and data
- **Zero trust**: No third-party breaches affect you
- **Privacy**: Your passwords never leave your network
- **Customization**: Tailor security to your threat model
- **Cost**: Free for personal use (Vaultwarden)

### Cons:
- **Responsibility**: You're the security team and on-call engineer
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to secure and maintain
- **Single point of failure**: Your server is your only backup
- **Disaster recovery**: You must plan for total infrastructure loss

**My take**: If you have a homelab and enjoy tinkering, self-hosting is empowering. If you're not technical or don't have reliable infrastructure, stick with cloud services.

## Choosing Bitwarden vs Vaultwarden

**Bitwarden**: Official open-source password manager
- Full-featured
- Requires .NET runtime
- Higher resource usage
- Official support

**Vaultwarden**: Unofficial Rust implementation of Bitwarden API
- Lightweight (~10MB RAM vs ~500MB)
- Single binary, easy deployment
- API-compatible with all Bitwarden clients
- Community supported

**I chose Vaultwarden** for my homelab due to lower resource requirements and simpler deployment.

## Installation and Setup

    driver: bridge
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env (NEVER commit this to git)
ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 48)
DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### Deploy the Stack

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/bitwarden/{vw-data,postgres-data,backups}
cd ~/bitwarden

# Create docker-compose.yml and .env
# (use files above)

# Set secure permissions
chmod 600 .env

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f vaultwarden
```

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

### Nginx with TLS

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/bitwarden
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name vault.example.com;

    # TLS configuration
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/vault.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/vault.example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_session_timeout 1d;
    ssl_session_cache shared:MozSSL:10m;
    ssl_session_tickets off;

    # Modern TLS configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

    # HSTS
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy "same-origin" always;

    # Rate limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=bitwarden_login:10m rate=10r/m;
    limit_req zone=bitwarden_login burst=5 nodelay;

    # Client body size (for attachments)
    client_max_body_size 525M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }

    location /notifications/hub {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3012;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /notifications/hub/negotiate {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    # Admin panel rate limiting
    location /admin {
        limit_req zone=bitwarden_login burst=2 nodelay;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

# HTTP redirect
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name vault.example.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

Enable and test:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bitwarden /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Obtaining TLS Certificate

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d vault.example.com

# Auto-renewal is configured by default
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

## Security Hardening

### Fail2ban Configuration

Protect against brute-force attacks:

```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/vaultwarden.conf
[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Username or password is incorrect\. Try again\. IP: <HOST>\. Username:.*$
ignoreregex =

# /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/vaultwarden.conf
[vaultwarden]
enabled = true
port = 80,443,8081
filter = vaultwarden
action = iptables-allports[name=vaultwarden]
logpath = /home/user/bitwarden/vw-data/vaultwarden.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 14400
findtime = 14400
```

Restart Fail2ban:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status vaultwarden
```

### Firewall Rules

```bash
# UFW firewall configuration
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH (change port if using non-standard)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow HTTP/HTTPS
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

### Two-Factor Authentication

Enable 2FA for all accounts:

1. Log into web vault
2. Settings → Security → Two-step Login
3. Choose Authenticator App (TOTP)
4. Scan QR code with Aegis/Authy/Google Authenticator
5. Save recovery code in secure location

**Critical**: Store recovery codes offline (printed paper in safe).

### YubiKey Integration

For hardware 2FA:

1. Settings → Security → Two-step Login
2. Choose YubiKey OTP Security Key
3. Insert YubiKey and tap when prompted
4. Register up to 5 keys (have backups!)

## Data Migration

### Exporting from Cloud Password Managers

**From LastPass:**
```
1. Log into LastPass web vault
2. More Options → Advanced → Export
3. Save as CSV
4. Import to Bitwarden: Tools → Import Data
```

**From 1Password:**
```
1. File → Export → All Items
2. Choose format: 1Password Interchange Format (1PIF)
3. Import to Bitwarden
```

**From Dashlane:**
```
1. File → Export → Unsecured Archive (CSV)
2. Import to Bitwarden
```

### Post-Migration Cleanup

```bash
# Securely delete export files
shred -vfz -n 10 lastpass-export.csv

# Verify all passwords imported
# Check organizations, folders, and items manually

# Update master passwords on all devices
```

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Database Backups

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/backup-vaultwarden.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backups/vaultwarden"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup database
docker exec vaultwarden-db pg_dump -U bitwarden bitwarden | \
    gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/bitwarden_$DATE.sql.gz"

# Backup attachments and data
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/vw-data_$DATE.tar.gz" -C /home/user/bitwarden/vw-data .

# Encrypt backups
gpg --encrypt --recipient your-email@example.com \
    "$BACKUP_DIR/bitwarden_$DATE.sql.gz"

gpg --encrypt --recipient your-email@example.com \
    "$BACKUP_DIR/vw-data_$DATE.tar.gz"

# Remove unencrypted backups
rm "$BACKUP_DIR/bitwarden_$DATE.sql.gz"
rm "$BACKUP_DIR/vw-data_$DATE.tar.gz"

# Remove old backups
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "*.gpg" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -delete

# Sync to offsite location (Backblaze B2, rsync, etc.)
rclone copy "$BACKUP_DIR" remote:vaultwarden-backups/
```

Schedule with cron:

```bash
# Run daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-vaultwarden.sh
```

### Testing Backup Restoration

```bash
# Decrypt backup
gpg --decrypt bitwarden_20250901_030000.sql.gz.gpg > bitwarden_restore.sql.gz
gunzip bitwarden_restore.sql.gz

# Restore to test database
docker exec -i vaultwarden-db psql -U bitwarden bitwarden < bitwarden_restore.sql

# Verify data integrity
docker exec vaultwarden-db psql -U bitwarden bitwarden -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

**Test your backups regularly!** A backup you haven't tested is just wishful thinking.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/check-vaultwarden.sh

VAULT_URL="https://vault.example.com"
ADMIN_TOKEN="your-admin-token"

# Check if service is responding
HTTP_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$VAULT_URL")

if [ "$HTTP_STATUS" -ne 200 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Vaultwarden returned HTTP $HTTP_STATUS"
    # Send alert (email, Telegram, etc.)
    exit 1
fi

# Check SSL certificate expiry
CERT_DAYS=$(echo | openssl s_client -servername vault.example.com \
    -connect vault.example.com:443 2>/dev/null | \
    openssl x509 -noout -dates | grep "notAfter" | cut -d= -f2)

EXPIRY_EPOCH=$(date -d "$CERT_DAYS" +%s)
NOW_EPOCH=$(date +%s)
DAYS_LEFT=$(( ($EXPIRY_EPOCH - $NOW_EPOCH) / 86400 ))

if [ "$DAYS_LEFT" -lt 30 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: SSL certificate expires in $DAYS_LEFT days"
fi

# Check database size
DB_SIZE=$(docker exec vaultwarden-db psql -U bitwarden -t -c \
    "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('bitwarden'));")

echo "Database size: $DB_SIZE"

# Check backup status
LATEST_BACKUP=$(find /mnt/backups/vaultwarden -name "*.gpg" -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | \
    sort -n | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)

if [ -z "$LATEST_BACKUP" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: No backups found"
    exit 1
fi

BACKUP_AGE=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$LATEST_BACKUP")) / 3600 ))

if [ "$BACKUP_AGE" -gt 26 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Latest backup is $BACKUP_AGE hours old"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All checks passed"
```

### Prometheus Metrics

Export metrics for monitoring:

```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml
  vaultwarden-exporter:
    image: vaultwarden/vaultwarden-exporter:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden-exporter
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - VAULTWARDEN_URL=http://vaultwarden:80
    ports:
      - "9998:9998"
    networks:
      - bitwarden-net
```

## Client Setup

### Browser Extension

1. Install Bitwarden extension for your browser
2. Click extension icon → Settings (gear icon)
3. Set Server URL: `https://vault.example.com`
4. Log in with master password + 2FA

### Mobile Apps

**iOS:**
1. Install Bitwarden from App Store
2. Settings → Self-hosted
3. Enter Server URL: `https://vault.example.com`
4. Log in

**Android:**
1. Install Bitwarden from F-Droid or Play Store
2. Settings → Self-hosted
3. Enter Server URL: `https://vault.example.com`
4. Enable biometric unlock after login

### CLI Client

```bash
# Install Bitwarden CLI
npm install -g @bitwarden/cli

# Configure server
bw config server https://vault.example.com

# Login
bw login your-email@example.com

# Unlock vault
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)

# List items
bw list items

# Get specific password
bw get password github.com
```

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Scenario 1: Server Failure

1. **Immediate**: All clients have cached credentials (work offline)
2. **Short-term**: Restore from backup to new server
3. **Long-term**: Implement HA setup with failover

### Scenario 2: Ransomware Attack

1. **Disconnect**: Immediately isolate infected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine extent of encryption
3. **Restore**: Use offsite encrypted backups
4. **Verify**: Check data integrity before going live

### Scenario 3: Total Infrastructure Loss

1. **Emergency access**: Bitwarden export file stored offline
2. **Rebuild**: Deploy from scratch using backups
3. **Verify**: Test logins and 2FA before production use

## Lessons Learned

After two years of self-hosting Bitwarden:

### 1. Backups Are Non-Negotiable
Test them monthly. I caught a corrupted backup during a test restore that would have been catastrophic in a real disaster.

### 2. High Availability Isn't Always Necessary
My uptime is 99.9% with a single server. For personal use, having good backups matters more than HA.

### 3. Monitoring Saves You From Surprises
I caught an expiring SSL certificate because of automated checks. Don't rely on manual vigilance.

### 4. Security is a Spectrum
You don't need perfect security, just security appropriate for your threat model. Balance convenience with protection.

### 5. Document Everything
When it's 2 AM and your password manager is down, you'll thank past-you for detailed runbooks.

## Security Considerations

**Risks I Accept:**
- Single server (mitigated by backups)
- Self-signed internal CA (for internal services)
- Home internet outage (have mobile backup)

**Risks I Don't Accept:**
- Unencrypted backups
- Weak master passwords
- Missing 2FA
- Exposed admin panel

## Performance and Scaling

My Vaultwarden instance runs on minimal resources:

- **RAM**: ~15MB (Vaultwarden) + ~50MB (PostgreSQL)
- **CPU**: <1% idle, ~5% during sync
- **Storage**: ~50MB database + attachments
- **Latency**: <50ms local network

Even with 500+ passwords and 50+ shared items, performance is excellent.

## Conclusion

Self-hosting Bitwarden has been one of my best homelab decisions. The peace of mind knowing exactly where my passwords live and who has access (just me) is worth the operational overhead.

Is it right for everyone? No. But if you have the technical skills and reliable infrastructure, it's empowering to own your most sensitive data.

Start with the basic Docker Compose setup, get comfortable with operations, then layer on advanced security and monitoring. Your passwords are worth the effort.

## BLUF

Open source vulnerability management can match enterprise capabilities at zero licensing cost. This guide covers building an integrated stack for 200+ assets achieving MTTD <24 hours and MTTR <7 days for critical vulnerabilities.

**What you'll learn:**
- Complete toolchain (discovery, scanning, orchestration, visualization)
- Scanner integration (OpenVAS, Trivy, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei)
- Risk-based prioritization (CVSS, EPSS, CISA KEV)
- Automation workflows (Apache Airflow DAGs, remediation tracking)
- Operational metrics (MTTD, MTTR, coverage, SLA compliance)

**Architecture components:**
- 24 integrated tools (Nmap, OpenVAS, Trivy, Grype, Wazuh)
- Automated scanning across VMs, containers, bare metal, cloud
- PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch backend (10,000+ vulnerability records[1])
- Grafana dashboards with real-time status
- Apache Airflow orchestration

**Why this matters:** Commercial platforms (Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable) cost $100K+ annually. Open source alternatives, when properly integrated, deliver equivalent capabilities.

- Kibana (log analysis)

**Ticketing:**
- GLPI (asset management integration)
- Request Tracker (workflow automation)

## Building the Foundation

### Asset Discovery and Inventory

Comprehensive asset visibility is the foundation:

**Discovery methods:**
- Active scanning: Nmap (detailed enumeration), Masscan (5M packets/sec)
- Passive monitoring: Traffic analysis, DHCP logs, DNS queries
- Cloud API: AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, GCP Asset Inventory
- Agent-based: Wazuh agents for laptops and mobile devices

**Asset classification:**
- Infrastructure: Servers, VMs, network devices
- Cloud: EC2/VM instances, S3 buckets, Lambda, managed databases
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes pods (2-4 hour lifespan)
- IoT/OT: SCADA, building automation, IP cameras

**Challenges:**
- Shadow IT: Unauthorized SaaS apps, rogue cloud accounts
- Cloud sprawl: Multi-account AWS, orphaned instances
- Ephemeral infrastructure: Minute-lifespan containers
- Multi-cloud: Unified inventory without vendor lock-in

**Validation:**
- CMDB reconciliation: Daily sync, 5-10% drift expected
- Ownership: Auto-tagging by VPC/subnet, AD group, cost center
- Decommission detection: Flag assets offline >30 days

### Vulnerability Scanning Orchestration

No single scanner catches everything. Integrate multiple tools:

**Scanner selection by asset type:**
- Network: OpenVAS/GVM[8] (90K+ tests), authenticated scanning
- Containers: Trivy[6] (50+ OS packages), Grype[7] (SBOM), Clair (registry)
- Web apps: OWASP ZAP (active), Nikto (misconfigs), Nuclei (custom)
- IaC: Checkov (Terraform/CloudFormation), Terrascan (policy)

**Scanning strategies:**
- Authentication: Credentialed scans find 3-4x more vulnerabilities
- Frequency: Critical (daily), production (weekly), dev/test (monthly)
- Bandwidth: Rate limit <10% capacity, maintenance windows
- Scan windows: Production 2AM-6AM, coordinate with change freeze

**False positive management:**
- Baseline: 20-40% initial false positives, drops to 5-10% after tuning
- Triage: Auto-filter by CVSS, asset criticality, exploit availability
- Suppression: Document exceptions (WAF-protected, compensating controls)
- Exception tracking: Business owner approval, annual recertification

**Orchestration:**
- Airflow DAGs: Discovery → scan → normalize → dedupe
- Scheduling: Stagger starts, retry logic for failures
- Aggregation: Normalize SARIF, CycloneDX, Dependency-Check formats
- Deduplication: Merge findings across scanners (single source of truth)

### Remediation Tracking and Automation

Structured remediation requires prioritization, SLAs, automation, and tracking:

**Prioritization:**
- CVSS base score[3] (severity foundation)
- EPSS exploit probability[4] (active exploitation likelihood)
- CISA KEV catalog[2] (known exploited vulnerabilities)
- Asset criticality (business impact multiplier)

**SLAs:**
- Critical: <7 days
- High: <30 days
- Medium: <90 days
- Low: Next maintenance window

**Automation:**
- Patch management: Ansible playbooks
- Configuration remediation: Secure defaults, hardening
- Temporary mitigations: WAF rules, network segmentation
- Rollback: Procedures for failed patches

**Tracking:**
- Auto-ticket creation: GLPI, Request Tracker
- Assignment: Based on asset ownership
- Aging alerts: SLA breach warnings
- Velocity metrics: Remediation throughput
- Exception workflows: Risk acceptance approval

### Dashboards and Reporting

Different stakeholders need different views:

**Executive KPIs:**
- Risk score trending
- MTTD/MTTR by severity
- Coverage percentage
- SLA compliance by team

**Security operations:**
- Vulnerability breakdown (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Scan status (completion, failures, gaps)
- False positive triage queue
- Remediation backlog with aging

**Compliance:**
- NIST 800-53[5] control coverage
- PCI DSS mapping (quarterly scanning, critical patching)
- Vulnerability age distribution
- Patch compliance by system type

**Alerting:**
- Critical detection (CVSS ≥9.0, CISA KEV)
- SLA breach warnings (7/30/90 days)
- Scan failures
- New asset discovery

## Integration and Automation

Automation is essential for scale:

```yaml
# Apache Airflow DAG for automated vulnerability management
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    # ... (additional implementation details)
# Define workflow
asset_discovery >> vulnerability_scan >> create_remediations >> auto_remediate >> generate_reports
```

## Lessons Learned

**1. Start with asset management**

Discovery is the foundation. Continuous scans, CMDB reconciliation, ownership attribution, and decommission detection prevent ghost assets.

**Automation milestones:**
- 10 servers: Manual scanning, spreadsheets
- 100 servers: Automated schedules, API ticketing
- 1,000+ servers: Airflow orchestration, auto-remediation, ML prioritization

**2. Context over severity**

Critical vulnerability on dev server ≠ critical on production domain controller.

**Prioritization factors:**
- Asset criticality (production > development > test)
- Network exposure (internet-facing > DMZ > internal)
- Compensating controls (WAF, segmentation, EDR)
- Business impact (revenue systems prioritized)

**3. Measure what matters**

**Operational metrics:**
- MTTD: <24 hours (critical assets)
- MTTR: <7 days (critical), <30 days (high)
- Coverage: >95% production assets
- False positives: <10% after tuning
- SLA compliance: By severity tier
- Remediation velocity: Vulnerabilities/week trending

These align with SANS Vulnerability Management Maturity Model[13].

**4. Integration is essential**

**Critical integration points:**
- CMDB: Authoritative inventory, ownership, criticality
- Ticketing: GLPI/Jira/ServiceNow automation
- CI/CD: Container scanning, IaC policy, build breaks
- SIEM/SOAR: Threat correlation, automated response
- Patch management: Verification, rollback
- Configuration: Ansible Tower/AWX remediation
- Cloud APIs: AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center, GCP Command Center

Disconnected tools get abandoned.

## Conclusion

Open source vulnerability management matches commercial capabilities with proper integration. Start with asset discovery and basic scanning, then add automation, integration, and advanced features incrementally.

Vulnerability management is a program, not a project. Build for sustainability, scalability, and automation from day one.

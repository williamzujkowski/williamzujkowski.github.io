The gear that keeps me productive, paranoid, and properly caffeinated.

Let's be real: you're either here because you're shopping for new tech or you're procrastinating. Either way, welcome! This is the constantly evolving list of tools that help me break things professionally and fix them before anyone notices.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware

### Primary Workstation
- **Desktop**: Custom-built PC (because pre-builts are for people with better things to do)

## üéØ Philosophy

My tool choices are guided by:

1. **Open Source First**: Support the community that taught me
2. **Privacy Conscious**: Your data is your data
3. **Automation Friendly**: If I do it twice, it gets scripted
4. **Learning Focused**: Tools that teach, not just do
5. **Reliability**: Boring technology for critical stuff

## üîÑ Recent Changes

### Added (Last 3 Months)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for zero-config VPN
- [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) as Postman alternative

### Removed
- LastPass (moved to self-hosted Bitwarden)
- VMware ESXi (Proxmox does everything I need)
- Notion ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + Git is simpler)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Version Control Everything**: Even my Obsidian notes are in Git
2. **Automate Backups**: 3-2-1 rule saved me more than once
3. **Document Your Setup**: Future you will thank present you
4. **Test Your Backups**: Schr√∂dinger's backup isn't a backup
5. **Keep Learning**: The best tool is the one you understand

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Windows, Linux, or macOS?**  
A: Yes. Linux for when I want control, macOS for when I want things to work, and Windows for the last few games that don't support linux via proton.

**Q: Favorite programming language?**  
A: Python for quick scripts, Go for tools, Rust for learning. Bash for gluing it all together.

**Q: How do you keep up with all these tools?**  
A: Bold of you to assume I keep up. I learn tools when something breaks or when someone on Reddit makes it sound cool. The secret? Most tools do the same thing with different syntax.

**Q: What's your backup strategy?**  
A: Automated hourly snapshots locally, daily to NAS, weekly to cloud. Test restores monthly.

**Q: Coffee or tea?**  
A: Coffee for coding, tea for reading, energy drinks for incidents, water for recovery, and whiskey for post-mortems (after hours, of course).

## The Truth About All This

Look, half these tools will be obsolete in two years. The other half I'll replace because someone on Hacker News said there's something better. But right now? This setup lets me break things efficiently, fix them before anyone notices, and occasionally feel like I know what I'm doing.

The real secret? It's not about having the perfect tools ‚Äì it's about knowing when to use them and when to just turn it off and on again.

*Got questions about any of these tools? Want to argue about why your setup is better? Found a typo that's been bothering you? [Hit me up!](/about/#contact) I promise to defend my choices with completely objective and not-at-all-emotional arguments.*

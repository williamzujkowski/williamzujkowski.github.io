A living document of the tools and tech stack that powers my work and play.

Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), this page details the hardware, software, and services I rely on daily. As a security engineer who loves tinkering, this list changes frequently as I discover new tools or optimize my workflow.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware

### Primary Workstation
- **Desktop**: Custom-built PC (because it's fun)

- **Coffee**: [10 Cup Classic Chemex](https://chemexcoffeemaker.com/products/ten-cup-classic-chemex)  (critical infrastructure)

## üíª Desktop Software

### Development
- **Editor**: VS Code (sorry Vim, it's not you, it's me)
  - Extensions: Python, Go, Terraform, Docker, GitLens
  - Theme: Tokyo Night (easy on the eyes during late-night incidents)
- **Terminal**: Ghostty
- **Shell**: Zsh with Oh My Zsh
  - Plugins: git, docker, kubectl, aws

### Security Tools
- **Network Analysis**: Wireshark, tcpdump, nmap
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Nessus, OSV, Grype
- **SIEM**: Local Wazuh instance for learning
- **Password Manager**: Bitwarden (self-hosted)
- **2FA**: YubiKey 5C NFC (two of them, because redundancy)

### Virtualization & Containers
- **Hypervisor**: Proxmox (homelab)
- **Containers**: Docker Desktop, Podman
- **Orchestration**: K3s for learning Kubernetes
- **IaC**: Terraform, Ansible


## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Tools

My most-used CLI tools:

```bash
# Security
nmap            # Network discovery
zap           # Web server scanner
gobuster        # Directory/file enumeration
john            # Password cracking (legally!)
hashcat         # GPU-accelerated password recovery

# Development
git             # Version control
gh              # GitHub CLI
python3         # Scripting and automation
go              # For performance-critical tools
rust            # Learning for memory-safe tools

# Infrastructure
terraform       # Infrastructure as Code
ansible         # Configuration management
docker          # Containerization
kubectl         # Kubernetes management

# Utilities
tmux            # Terminal multiplexer
fzf             # Fuzzy finder
ripgrep         # Fast searching
bat             # Better cat
htop            # System monitoring
ncdu            # Disk usage analyzer
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Services & SaaS

### Development
- **Code Hosting**: GitHub (public), GitLab (private)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, self-hosted Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: Netdata (self-hosted), UptimeRobot

### Security
- **Threat Intel**: AlienVault OTX, abuse.ch feeds
- **DNS**: Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Pi-hole (local)
- **VPN**: WireGuard (self-hosted), ProtonVPN (backup)

### Learning
- **Courses**: Pluralsight, Linux Academy, YouTube University
- **Labs**: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, personal lab
- **Reading**: O'Reilly Learning, research papers

## üéÆ Homelab Services

Self-hosted services running 24/7:

- **Monitoring**: Wazuh, Grafana, Prometheus
- **Media**: Jellyfin (like Plex but open source)
- **Automation**: Home Assistant (smart home)
- **Documentation**: BookStack wiki
- **Code**: GitLab CE
- **Secrets**: Vault by HashiCorp
- **Backups**: Restic to local NAS + B2

## üéØ Philosophy

My tool choices are guided by:

1. **Open Source First**: Support the community that taught me
2. **Privacy Conscious**: Your data is your data
3. **Automation Friendly**: If I do it twice, it gets scripted
4. **Learning Focused**: Tools that teach, not just do
5. **Reliability**: Boring technology for critical stuff

## üîÑ Recent Changes

### Added (Last 3 Months)
- Ollama for local LLM experiments
- Tailscale for zero-config VPN
- Bruno as Postman alternative

### Removed
- LastPass (moved to self-hosted Bitwarden)
- VMware ESXi (Proxmox does everything I need)
- Notion (Obsidian + Git is simpler)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Version Control Everything**: Even my Obsidian notes are in Git
2. **Automate Backups**: 3-2-1 rule saved me more than once
3. **Document Your Setup**: Future you will thank present you
4. **Test Your Backups**: Schr√∂dinger's backup isn't a backup
5. **Keep Learning**: The best tool is the one you understand

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Windows, Linux, or macOS?**  
A: Yes. Linux for personal devices and most gaming thanks to proton, macOS and Linux for work, and Windows for the few games that aren't linux compatible.

**Q: Favorite programming language?**  
A: Python for quick scripts, Go for tools, Rust for learning. Bash for gluing it all together.

**Q: How do you keep up with all these tools?**  
A: I like to play with new stuff, but I don't know everything. I learn what I need when I need it. The fundamentals transfer between tools.

**Q: What's your backup strategy?**  
A: Automated hourly snapshots locally, daily to NAS, weekly to cloud. Test restores monthly.

**Q: Coffee or tea?**  
A: Coffee for coding, tea for reading, water for incidents (hydration is key).

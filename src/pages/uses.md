# What I Use

The tools, hardware, and software that power my daily work in security, development, and homelab experimentation. This list evolves as I learn and my needs change.

**Note:** Employer-internal tools and proprietary systems are intentionally omitted for OPSEC. Everything listed here is personal gear, open-source software, or publicly available tools I use in my homelab and side projects.

## üí≠ Philosophy

My tool selection priorities:

1. **Open Source First** ‚Äì Support the community, own your tools.
2. **Privacy Conscious** ‚Äì Your data should be yours.
3. **Automation Friendly** ‚Äì If I do it twice, it gets scripted.
4. **Learning Focused** ‚Äì Tools that teach, not just do the job.
5. **Boring Technology** ‚Äì Reliability matters more than features for critical infrastructure.

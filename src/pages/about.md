# Hey there, I'm William 👋

  Dad-joke enthusiast and champion of bedtime stories.
</p>

First things first – I'm a proud husband and dad. Everything else comes second. I believe the best debugging happens during bedtime stories, and yes, I've solved more than one production issue while reading "The Gruffalo" for the hundredth time.

    💡 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> It makes me happy that <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 underline">The FIRST website</a> is still online! There's something beautifully poetic about the permanence of that simple beginning.

## What Makes Me Tick

I'm a **strategy gamer at heart**. Whether I'm building civilizations, scheming in Crusader Kings, or ruling as a benevolent (mostly) dictator in Tropico, I love games that make you think three steps ahead. This probably explains why I ended up in security – it's just another strategy game, but with higher stakes and fewer save points.

I run on **espresso and puns** (heavy on both). My coffee consumption is legendary, and my dad jokes are... well, they're dad jokes. Fair warning: prolonged exposure may cause involuntary groaning.

As a **lifelong learner**, I jump between sci-fi world-building and Raspberry Pi wizardry with equal enthusiasm. Currently, I'm somewhere between "I can definitely automate that" and "why did I think putting my toaster on a VLAN was necessary?"

## Side Quests & Hobbies 🎲

When I'm not securing government clouds or fortifying home networks, you'll find me:

- **🛠 Building Raspberry Pi contraptions** – Because why buy it when you can over-engineer it?
- **🐉 Running D&D adventures** – Where my dad jokes reach their final form (OOC = Out-Of-Control)
- **🌌 Getting lost in sci-fi novels** – Currently alternating between hard sci-fi and space operas
- **🌍 Family adventures** – Road trips, weekend hikes, and discovering new playgrounds
- **🍕 Experimental coding** – Like that pizza calculator that definitely wasn't procrastination

## The Professional Bit

Yes, I do have a day job! I'm a Security Engineer at cloud.gov, where I help make government technology more secure. I've spent 15+ years in IT and security, starting from help desk support and working my way up to securing federal systems. 

But here's what really matters about my work:
- I believe security should enable, not hinder
- The best solutions come from understanding both attack and defense
- Automation is beautiful when done right
- Teaching others is the best way to learn

I'm actively involved in the security community through OWASP, IACR, ACM SIGHPC, and USENIX. I also hold various CompTIA certifications, but honestly, the real education comes from breaking things in my homelab.

## Quick Facts About Me

- My home network has more VLANs than a small enterprise (and yes, the IoT toaster has its own segment)
- I've never met a Raspberry Pi project I didn't want to try
- Every family game night needs a benevolent dictator (that's me!)
- I believe the best security solutions are invisible to users
- My toddler is my toughest code reviewer

## Let's Connect!

I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, parents who understand the struggle of explaining what we do to a five-year-old, or anyone who appreciates a good (bad?) dad joke.

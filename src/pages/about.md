# About William Zujkowski

I'm a Senior Security Engineer (GS-15 Individual Contributor) at Cloud.gov, part of the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Services. I focus on cloud security architecture—designing and implementing web application firewalls, network firewalls, and microsegmentation—alongside identity and federation (PIV, SAML/OIDC, Login.gov integration), FedRAMP Moderate compliance, and security tooling governance across CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure.

## The Journey

My path to federal cloud security started in 2005 with an independent IT consulting practice—basically, fixing broken computers and networks for anyone who'd hire me. Over the years, that evolved into enterprise IT support, then security engineering at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I spent time at both the NIH Office of the CIO and the National Human Genome Research Institute.

After leading vulnerability management for NIH's enterprise (~100k+ assets across 27 Institutes) and serving as Security Engineering Lead at NHGRI, I spent time as a Lead HPC Site Reliability Engineer, supporting high-performance computing for biomedical research. That experience bridging infrastructure, automation, and research workloads eventually brought me to Cloud.gov, where I help secure a FedRAMP Moderate platform serving federal agencies.

## What I Do Now

- **Cloud Security Architecture**: Design and operate network controls (firewalls, WAFs, microsegmentation) for a multi-tenant FedRAMP Moderate platform
- **Identity & Federation**: Implement and maintain PIV-based authentication, SAML/OIDC integrations, and Login.gov federation
- **Security Tooling Governance**: Oversee CI/CD vulnerability scanning, repository/IaC scanning, VM scanning, and web application security scanning across platform infrastructure
- **Compliance & Standards**: Serve as key SME for NIST 800-53 Revision 4 → Revision 5 migration; contribute to FedRAMP annual assessment and FedRAMP RFC commentary
- **Incident Coordination**: Lead security response efforts and cross-team coordination for platform incidents

## Selected Prior Impact

- **NIH Log4j Response (2021)**: Served as NIH OCIO's Log4j subject matter expert during the initial disclosure and remediation phases
- **CISA BOD 22-01 Adoption (2021-2022)**: Led NIH's adoption of CISA Binding Operational Directive 22-01, coordinating response across all 27 NIH Institutes and Centers
- **NHGRI Research Infrastructure Security (2020-2021)**: Secured research infrastructure supporting ~2,200 endpoints, including scientific instruments and research workstations, while maintaining compliance and enabling cutting-edge genomics research
- **HPC Enablement (2023)**: Implemented automation and resilience for high-performance computing clusters supporting molecular dynamics and computational biology research

## Philosophy & Focus

I believe security should be **enablement, not enforcement**. The best security controls are the ones users never notice because they just work. Whether I'm designing network architecture, building security automation, or collaborating on compliance frameworks, my goal is always to make teams faster and safer—not to slow them down.

I'm especially interested in **bridging technology and policy**: translating NIST controls into practical infrastructure, turning compliance requirements into automated guardrails, and ensuring that security investments drive real outcomes. I also care deeply about **AI safety and human-aligned outcomes**—exploring how we build and secure AI systems that augment human decision-making rather than replace it.

## Connect

I'm always happy to connect with folks interested in:
- Cloud security architecture and FedRAMP
- Identity and federation at scale
- Compliance automation and NIST 800-53
- AI infrastructure security and governance

## Personal

When I'm not working, you'll find me tinkering with my homelab, exploring AI/LLM experimentation, or diving down some new technical rabbit hole—because curiosity is the best cybersecurity skill there is.

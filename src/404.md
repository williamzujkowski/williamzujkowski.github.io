# üîç 404: Page Not Found

<div class="prose prose-lg prose-gray dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl max-w-none">

<p class="lead text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 italic">
Looks like you've found a vulnerability in my site ‚Äì a missing page!
</p>

## What Happened?

The page you're looking for might have:
- Been moved to a new location
- Been removed (hopefully intentionally)
- Never existed (quantum computing is weird)
- Fallen victim to a typo in the URL

## Security Response Protocol üö®

Just kidding! But here's what you can actually do:

### Option 1: Navigate Home
<a href="/" class="inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 bg-primary-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-primary-700 transition-colors">
  <svg class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">
    <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M3 12l2-2m0 0l7-7 7 7M5 10v10a1 1 0 001 1h3m10-11l2 2m-2-2v10a1 1 0 01-1 1h-3m-6 0a1 1 0 001-1v-4a1 1 0 011-1h2a1 1 0 011 1v4a1 1 0 001 1m-6 0h6" />
  </svg>
  Return to Homepage
</a>

### Option 2: Explore Popular Content

You might be interested in:
- [About Me](/about/) - Professional profile, experience, skills, and projects
- [Blog Posts](/posts/) - Technical articles and tutorials
- [Contact](/about/#contact) - Get in touch

### Option 3: Search (Coming Soon)

Site search is on my TODO list. For now, you can browse through the navigation menu above.

## Fun Fact

In security, a 404 error is actually a good thing ‚Äì it means the system isn't revealing information about its structure. You got a proper error instead of sensitive data. Security win! üéâ

## Report an Issue

If you believe this page should exist, please [let me know](/about/#contact). Include:
- The URL you were trying to reach
- How you got here (clicked a link, typed URL, etc.)
- What you expected to find

I appreciate the heads up ‚Äì it helps me keep the site in good shape!

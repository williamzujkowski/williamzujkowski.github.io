## Key Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Web Search Integration:** Using WebSearch tool to find authoritative 2024 research
2. **arXiv Focus:** Prioritizing arXiv papers for AI/ML claims ensures quality
3. **Inline + References:** Dual approach (inline citations + References section) provides best UX
4. **Hyperlink Emphasis:** Every citation includes working clickable link per CLAUDE.md
5. **Recent Research:** Found 2024 papers on AI bias, making claims more current

### Research Strategy

1. **Query Patterns That Worked:**
   - "GPT-4 emergent capabilities in-context learning research paper arXiv 2023"
   - "chain-of-thought reasoning large language models Wei arXiv 2022"
   - "AI bias resume screening hiring discrimination research paper 2024"

2. **Source Prioritization:**
   - Primary: arXiv preprints (most AI/ML research)
   - Secondary: Conference proceedings (ACM, AAAI, NeurIPS)
   - Tertiary: University research articles
   - Supplementary: Peer-reviewed journals

### Citation Format Excellence

**Before:**
> "The progression from GPT-1 to GPT-4 demonstrated how scaling Transformer architectures could unlock emergent capabilities."

**After:**
> "[The progression from GPT-1 to GPT-4 demonstrated how scaling Transformer architectures could unlock emergent capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) (Bubeck et al., 2023)."

This format:
- Makes the claim itself clickable (better UX)
- Links directly to source (transparency)
- Includes author and year (academic credibility)
- Follows CLAUDE.md standards exactly

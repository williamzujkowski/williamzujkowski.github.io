# Token Budget Tracking (Accurate Measurements)
token_budgets:
  # Note: These are ACCURATE counts based on word count × 4
  # Previous estimates were 3.3x too low (42,233 vs 138,340)

  core_modules: 27448        # 5 modules (was: 20,256, measured via word count × 4)
  workflow_modules: 25884    # 5 modules (accurate)
  standards_modules: 47212   # 6 modules (was: 33,360, +blog-patterns.md)
  technical_modules: 26256   # 6 modules (accurate)
  reference_modules: 25352   # 4 modules (was: 14,480, +historical-learnings.md)
  template_modules: 18104    # 4 modules (accurate)

  actual_total: 170256       # MEASURED via comprehensive audit (Session 41, 2025-11-12)
  previous_estimate: 138340  # Previous underestimate by 23.1%
  measurement_method: "word count × 4 tokens/word"

  # Why modular loading is CRITICAL:
  # - Loading all 30 modules = 170K tokens (unsustainable)
  # - Typical blog post task = ~15-20K tokens (core + workflows + standards)
  # - Simple file operation = ~8-10K tokens (core modules only)
  # - Selective loading achieves 85-90% reduction vs loading everything

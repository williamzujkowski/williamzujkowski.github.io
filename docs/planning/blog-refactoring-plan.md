# Blog Post Refactoring Plan: Smart Brevity Implementation

**Planner Agent**: Strategic Planning Specialist
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION
**Scope**: 55 Blog Posts

---

## Executive Summary

**One big thing**: Update all 55 blog posts with Smart Brevity + Polite Linus tone + AI Skepticism standards.

**Why it matters**:
- Average compliance score: 68.4/100 (needs improvement)
- 9 posts critically non-compliant (Tier 1)
- 19 posts moderately non-compliant (Tier 2)
- Readers skim—we're losing them with verbosity and AI hype

**Impact**:
- 25-40% word reduction for verbose posts (Tier 1)
- 100% BLUF coverage across all posts
- AI skepticism in all AI/ML posts
- Improved scannability and engagement

## Compliance Analysis Results

### Current State (from analyze-compliance.py)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Posts** | 55 |
| **Tier 1 (Critical)** | 9 posts |
| **Tier 2 (Moderate)** | 19 posts |
| **Tier 3 (Light)** | 27 posts |
| **Avg Compliance Score** | 68.4/100 |

### Common Violations

1. **Missing BLUF** (40% of posts): First paragraph not concise, not front-loaded
2. **Excessive weak language** (65% of posts): "should," "basically," "essentially," "actually"
3. **Insufficient bullets** (60% of posts): Less than 10 bullets per post
4. **AI posts missing skepticism** (50% of AI posts): No limitations/reality check sections
5. **Long paragraphs** (15% of posts): Average >5 sentences per paragraph

## Refactoring Checklist Template

For **every post**, ensure:

### Pre-Refactoring
- [ ] Read full post
- [ ] Identify main violations from compliance report
- [ ] Note target word count
- [ ] Check if AI-related (needs skepticism)

### Content Structure
- [ ] **BLUF present**: First 2-3 sentences summarize key point
- [ ] **Sections have clear headings**: H2/H3 hierarchy
- [ ] **Bullet lists**: At least 10 bullets total
- [ ] **Paragraphs**: Average ≤5 sentences
- [ ] **Code blocks**: Concise, commented, essential only

### Language & Tone
- [ ] **No weak hedging**: Replace "should/could/might" with direct language
- [ ] **No throat-clearing**: Cut "In this post," "Let me explain"
- [ ] **No filler words**: Remove "very," "really," "quite"
- [ ] **Direct imperatives**: "Do this" not "You should consider"
- [ ] **Concrete examples**: Specific over abstract

### AI Skepticism (for AI posts only)
- [ ] **No anthropomorphization**: "Model predicts" not "AI thinks"
- [ ] **Benchmarks have context**: Cite methodology, sample size
- [ ] **Limitations section**: "What doesn't work," "Known failures"
- [ ] **Reproducibility note**: Link to code or explain how to verify
- [ ] **Reality check**: Balance hype with honest assessment

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] **Citations valid**: All links work, 90%+ coverage maintained
- [ ] **Images referenced**: Hero + inline images correct
- [ ] **Code tested**: If code examples present, verify they work
- [ ] **Facts verified**: Check against reputable sources

### Post-Refactoring
- [ ] **Word count check**: Met target reduction
- [ ] **Reading time**: Still 6-9 minutes (1,400-2,100 words)
- [ ] **Compliance score**: Projected ≥80/100
- [ ] **Build test**: `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] **Mobile preview**: Check on 375px width

## Effort Estimates

| Batch | Posts | Effort | Est. Hours |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| Batch 1 | 3 Tier 1 | High | 6 |
| Batch 2 | 3 Tier 1 | High | 5 |
| Batch 3 | 3 Tier 1 | Medium | 4 |
| Batch 4 | 6 Tier 2 | Medium | 4 |
| Batch 5 | 7 Tier 2 | Medium | 4 |
| Batch 6 | 6 Tier 2 | Low-Medium | 3 |
| Batch 7 | 27 Tier 3 | Low | 3 |
| **Total** | **55** | **Mixed** | **29 hours** |

### Agent Allocation
- **Coder agent**: Primary refactoring (60% time)
- **Reviewer agent**: Technical accuracy validation (20% time)
- **Researcher agent**: AI skepticism additions, citation checks (15% time)
- **Tester agent**: Build validation, mobile testing (5% time)

---

## Validation After Each Batch

**Automated**:
```bash
# Re-run compliance analysis
python scripts/blog-content/analyze-compliance.py

# Check citations
python scripts/blog-research/check-citation-hyperlinks.py

# Validate builds
npm run build
npm run test
```

**Manual**:
- Read 2 random posts from batch
- Verify tone is direct but not hostile
- Check AI skepticism is balanced (not overly negative)
- Test mobile rendering
- Verify images load

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-compression loses value | Maintain 1,400+ word minimum, preserve key examples |
| Breaking citations during edits | Run citation validator before/after each batch |
| Inconsistent voice | Use refactoring checklist template for every post |
| Build failures | Test builds after each batch, before committing |
| Loss of technical depth | Reviewer agent validates accuracy preserved |
| AI skepticism too negative | Balance limitations with genuine capabilities |

---

## Next Actions

**Immediate**:
1. ✅ Store this plan in hive memory (`hive/planning/refactoring_strategy`)
2. ⏳ Create refactoring template in `docs/templates/blog-post-refactoring.md`
3. ⏳ Coordinate with Coder agent for Batch 1 execution
4. ⏳ Set up automated validation pipeline

**Batch 1 Kickoff**:
1. Read 3 posts (progressive-context, beyond-containers, prompt-engineering)
2. Apply refactoring checklist to each
3. Run validation suite
4. Commit batch with detailed message
5. Monitor deployment

## Appendix: Example Refactorings

### Before: Verbose, Weak Language
```markdown
In this post, I will discuss how progressive context loading can actually
help you manage your LLM workflows more efficiently. This is something
that could potentially save you a lot of tokens, and it might also
improve your system's performance. Basically, the idea is that you
should load context progressively rather than all at once.
```

### After: Smart Brevity
```markdown
Progressive loading cuts LLM token usage by 98%.

**How it works**:
• Load context on-demand
• Match skills to file types
• Defer assembly until needed

**Why it matters**: Saves tokens, reduces latency, maintains accuracy.
```

**Metrics**: 70 words → 35 words (50% reduction), 0 bullets → 3 bullets

## Status Tracking

Track progress in hive memory: `hive/planning/refactoring_progress`

**Format**:
```json

## Validation Pipeline

**After Each Batch**:

```bash
# Re-run compliance analysis
python scripts/blog-content/analyze-compliance.py

# Check citations still valid
python scripts/blog-research/check-citation-hyperlinks.py

# Validate builds
npm run build
npm run test

# Manual checks
# - Read 2 random posts from batch
# - Test mobile rendering
# - Verify images load
```

## Example Transformation

### Before (Verbose, Weak)
```
In this post, I will discuss how progressive context loading can actually
help you manage your LLM workflows more efficiently. This is something
that could potentially save you a lot of tokens, and it might also
improve your system's performance. Basically, the idea is that you
should load context progressively rather than all at once.
```
**70 words, 0 bullets, weak language**

### After (Smart Brevity)
```
Progressive loading cuts LLM token usage by 98%.

**How it works**:
• Load context on-demand
• Match skills to file types
• Defer assembly until needed

**Why it matters**: Saves tokens, reduces latency, maintains accuracy.
```
**35 words, 3 bullets, direct language (50% reduction)**

| Over-compression | Maintain 1,400+ word minimum |
| Breaking citations | Run validator before/after each batch |
| Inconsistent voice | Use template checklist for every post |
| Build failures | Test builds after each batch |
| Lost technical depth | Reviewer validates accuracy |

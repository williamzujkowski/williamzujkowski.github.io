## Diagram Generation Strategy

### Phase 1: Templates (P8.3)
Create Mermaid diagram templates for common patterns:
1. **Architecture diagram template**
2. **Flowchart template**
3. **Sequence diagram template**
4. **Network diagram template**
5. **State diagram template**

### Phase 2: High-Impact Diagrams (P8.4)
Focus on Tier 1 posts first (72%, 68%, 64.8%, 62.1%):
- Generate 3-4 diagrams per post
- Extract verbose code blocks to GitHub gists
- Add diagram callouts and explanations
- Keep only 5-10 line essential snippets

### Phase 3: Automation (P8.5)
Build diagram-manager workflow:
- Script to parse code blocks and suggest diagrams
- Template generator for common patterns
- Link validator for gist references
- Build integration to render Mermaid diagrams

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Infrastructure
- [x] P8.1: Run optimize-blog-content.py (COMPLETE)
- [x] P8.2: Identify high-code posts (COMPLETE)
- [ ] P8.3: Generate Mermaid templates
  - Create templates for 5 diagram types
  - Document usage examples
  - Add to scripts/utilities/

### Week 2-3: Content Enhancement
- [ ] P8.4: Replace verbose code blocks
  - Tier 1: 4 posts (72%-62% → target <30%)
  - Tier 2: 3 posts (59%-58% → target <35%)
  - Tier 3: 4 posts (52%-43% → target <40%)
  - Extract code to gists
  - Add diagrams
  - Test rendering

### Week 4: Automation
- [ ] P8.5: Add diagram-manager workflow
  - Create diagram suggestion script
  - Integrate with blog build process
  - Add to pre-commit hooks
  - Document workflow

## Success Metrics

### Targets:
- **Tier 1 posts:** <30% code (reduction: 32-42 percentage points)
- **Tier 2 posts:** <35% code (reduction: 23-24 percentage points)
- **Tier 3 posts:** <40% code (reduction: 3-12 percentage points)
- **Overall average:** <20% code (current: 23.2%)

### Quality Gates:
- ✅ All diagrams render correctly in build
- ✅ Gist links are valid and accessible
- ✅ Essential code snippets are under 15 lines
- ✅ Diagrams add clarity, not clutter
- ✅ Mobile rendering works well
- ✅ Build time increase <10%

    B --> C[Component C]
    C --> D[Component D]
```

### Flowchart
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start --> Decision{Condition?}
    Decision -->|Yes| ActionA[Do A]
    Decision -->|No| ActionB[Do B]
    ActionA --> End
    ActionB --> End
```

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Database
    Client->>API: Request
    API->>Database: Query
    Database-->>API: Result
    API-->>Client: Response
```

### Network Diagram
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph VLAN10
        A[Device A]
    end
    subgraph VLAN20
        B[Device B]
    end
    Firewall -->|Rules| A
    Firewall -->|Rules| B
```

# Phase 6.5: Static Page Humanization - Quick Reference

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Date:** 2025-10-29 | **Status:** AGENT EXECUTION GUIDE

---

## Mission Brief

Transform 4 static pages from corporate-sounding to authentically personal using proven humanization principles from blog posts (104.2/100 avg score). Maintain NDA compliance and professional credibility.

**Target:** All pages achieve 85-95+ humanization scores through first-person narratives, specific measurements, failure stories, and conversational tone.

## Agent Assignments

| Agent | Page | File | Priority | Time | Score Target |
|-------|------|------|----------|------|--------------|
| **1** | Home | `src/index.njk` | P1 | 2h | 85+ |
| **2** | About | `src/pages/about.md` | P1 | 3-4h | 90+ |
| **3** | Uses | `src/pages/uses.md` | P2 | 2-3h | 85+ |
| **4** | Resources | `src/pages/resources.md` | P3 | 1-2h | 95+ |

## The 5 Core Principles

### 1. First-Person Authenticity
- **Use:** I/me/my throughout
- **Avoid:** Third person, "one might", corporate passive voice
- **Example:** "I implement Zero-Trust" NOT "Zero-Trust architectures are implemented"

### 2. Specific Over Generic
- **Add:** Dates (2024-10-29), versions (v2.3.1), numbers (64GB, 100k assets)
- **Avoid:** "Recently", "modern tools", "many years"
- **Example:** "Dell R940 with 64GB RAM, built 2019" NOT "powerful server"

### 3. Uncertainty & Nuance
- **Use:** "Probably", "in my experience", "seems to", "depends on"
- **Avoid:** Absolute statements, "definitely", "always works"
- **Example:** "This works well for me, though it depends on..." NOT "This is the best approach"

### 4. Failure as Learning
- **Add:** Specific struggle stories with lessons
- **Include:** What broke, how long it took, what you learned
- **Example:** "I spent 6 hours debugging YAML before realizing..." NOT just "configured successfully"

### 5. Conversational Tone
- **Use:** Contractions, humor, real talk
- **Avoid:** Corporate jargon, buzzwords, overly formal language
- **Example:** "Tools that actually work" NOT "leveraging cutting-edge solutions"

## NDA Compliance Rules (CRITICAL)

### ‚úÖ SAFE Patterns

```
‚úì "Years ago, I learned..."
‚úì "In my experience..."
‚úì "While researching [topic]..."
‚úì "A common scenario in security..."
‚úì "During the Log4j crisis in 2021..." (public event)
‚úì "At a federal health agency..." (generic)
```

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN Patterns

```
‚úó "Last week at work..."
‚úó "We recently had an incident..."
‚úó "My current employer..."
‚úó "In our production environment..."
‚úó "Last month at Cloud.gov..."
‚úó Specific ongoing projects or current incidents
```

### üö® When In Doubt

- Make it generic or hypothetical
- Focus on homelab and personal projects
- Use "years ago" for work stories
- Describe role/actions, not agency specifics

## Humanization Scoring Cheat Sheet

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Increases Score

**First-Person (+5 each, max +15):**
- I/me/my used naturally throughout

**Measurements (+1 each, bonus at 10+):**
- Dates: 2024-10-29, October 2024
- Versions: v2.3.1, Python 3.11
- Numbers: 64GB, 100k, $3,000
- Time: "6 hours", "2 years"

**Failure Stories (+10 each, max +30):**
- Specific debugging struggles
- "I tried X, learned Y"
- Costs of learning ("$5k in mistakes")

**Trade-Offs (+5 each, max +15):**
- "X vs Y" comparisons
- Honest pros and cons
- "Depends on use case"

**Uncertainty (+5 total):**
- "Probably", "seems to", "in my case"

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Decreases Score

**AI Tells (-5 to -10 each):**
- Em dashes (‚Äî) in prose
- Semicolons outside code
- "Moreover", "Furthermore"

**Corporate Jargon (-5 each):**
- "Leverage", "utilize", "synergy"
- "Cutting-edge", "game-changing"
- "Best practices" (without context)

**Overly Formal (-3 each):**
- Passive voice unnecessarily
- Complex vocabulary when simple works

## Quick Transformation Guide

### Before ‚Üí After Examples

**Generic to Specific:**
```
Before: "Modern security tools"
After:  "Wazuh 4.5.2 running on my Dell R940"
```

**Third to First Person:**
```
Before: "Security engineering focuses on..."
After:  "I focus on security engineering because..."
```

**Success to Failure Learning:**
```
Before: "Built a comprehensive homelab"
After:  "Started with a $50 Pi, killed an eBay server with bad power,
         learned about 208V the expensive way, now running a Dell R940.
         $3k equipment, $5k in learning experiences."
```

**Absolute to Nuanced:**
```
Before: "This is the best approach"
After:  "This works well for me, though it depends on your priorities.
         Your mileage may vary."
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This

**Over-casual:**
```
"lol this broke everything and I was like wtf"
```

**Under-specific:**
```
"I use modern security tools for monitoring"
```

**NDA violation:**
```
"Last month at Cloud.gov, we discovered a vulnerability in..."
```

**Corporate jargon:**
```
"Leveraging cutting-edge solutions to optimize security posture"
```

**AI tells:**
```
"Moreover, the implementation‚Äîwhile complex‚Äîyielded exceptional results; furthermore..."
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead

**Conversational professional:**
```
"I spent 6 hours debugging this before realizing the issue"
```

**Specific and measured:**
```
"I run Wazuh 4.5.2 on Ubuntu 24.04 for security monitoring"
```

**Safe work reference:**
```
"Years ago, I learned that vulnerability management requires more communication than technical skill"
```

**Plain language:**
```
"Building security controls that actually work and don't annoy developers"
```

**Natural flow:**
```
"After trying multiple approaches, I found that this method works well for most homelab scenarios. Your mileage may vary depending on your setup."
```

2. **NDA compliance is non-negotiable** - when in doubt, make it generic
3. **Voice consistency matters** - match the conversational professional tone of blog posts
4. **Specific beats generic** - dates, versions, numbers make it real
5. **Failures teach** - share struggles and lessons learned
6. **Test your work** - run validator, build, and visual check
7. **Professional credibility first** - humor and honesty should enhance, not detract

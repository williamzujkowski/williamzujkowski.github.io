## 🔥 Critical NDA Risk Mitigation

### The Post 8 Replacement Decision

**Issue Identified:**
- **Original Post:** "Building Security Mindset - Lessons from Field" (40/100)
- **Risk Factor:** "Lessons from field" language strongly implied government work references
- **User Priority:** HIGH - user flagged immediately, requested twice in rapid succession
- **Discovery Timing:** During Batch 4 planning phase (before execution)

**Risk Assessment:**
```
Risk Level: HIGH
Violation Type: NDA boundary (work-related content)
Pattern: "Lessons from field" → military/government context
CLAUDE.md Violation: Government work security guidelines
Action Required: REPLACE, do not attempt to fix
```

**Replacement Strategy:**

**Selected Alternative:** "AI at Edge Computing" (45/100)

**Replacement Criteria:**
- ✅ Same publication timeframe (2024)
- ✅ Similar baseline score (45 vs 40 - slightly easier, acceptable)
- ✅ Similar violation count (4 violations in both)
- ✅ Technical AI topic (safe for homelab examples)
- ✅ Zero work/field implications
- ✅ No government/military context

**Replacement Results:**
- **Final score:** 90/100 (excellent tier)
- **Improvement:** +45.0 points
- **NDA risk:** Completely eliminated
- **Validation:** Zero work references in final version
- **Commit:** Included in Wave 2 (6e328a4)

**Key Learning:** Proactive NDA risk scanning during planning phase prevented wasted agent work and potential compliance issues. The replacement strategy proved effective with zero quality compromise.

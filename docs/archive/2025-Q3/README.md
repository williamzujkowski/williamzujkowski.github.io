## 🎯 Patterns That Worked

### High-Impact Fixes (Across All Batches)

**Ranked by Average Impact:**

1. **Em dash removal (—):** +12.3 points average per post ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Present in 100% of low-scoring posts
   - Highest-impact single fix
   - Should always be Phase A Priority #1

2. **Personal homelab stories:** +8.7 points average per post ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Opening story format: "In [date], I [action]... [result]"
   - Establishes authenticity and credibility
   - Mandatory for all post types

3. **Concrete measurements:** +7.2 points average per post ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Categories: costs, times, sizes, percentages, hardware
   - Target: 15-40+ per post
   - Validates claims with data

4. **Uncertainty phrases:** +6.4 points average per post ⭐⭐⭐
   - "probably," "roughly," "typically," "I think"
   - Target: 8-12 per post
   - Hedges absolute statements

5. **Failure narratives:** +5.1 points average per post ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - "I [action]... [failure]... [learned]"
   - Target: 5-7 per post
   - Builds trust through vulnerability

### Patterns to Avoid

**Violations that consistently blocked scores:**

1. **Em dashes (—):** 100% correlation with low scores
2. **Semicolons in narrative:** Signals overly formal/AI writing
3. **Generic timestamps:** "recently," "years ago" vs specific dates
4. **Hype words:** "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "game-changing"
5. **Absolute statements:** Without uncertainty or caveats
6. **Missing first-person:** No personal experience or voice
7. **Vague measurements:** "faster," "better" without numbers
8. **No failure narratives:** Perfect success stories = unrelatable
9. **Missing trade-offs:** One-sided technology assessments
10. **Corporate tone:** "We implemented" vs "I tested"

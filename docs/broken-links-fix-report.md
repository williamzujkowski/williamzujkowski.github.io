## Solution Implemented
Modified `.eleventy.js` configuration file to add a custom `slug` filter that properly handles apostrophes:

```javascript
// Override the built-in slug filter to properly handle apostrophes
eleventyConfig.addFilter("slug", (str) => {
  if (!str) return "";
  return str.toString().toLowerCase()
    .replace(/['â€²'']/g, '')        // Remove apostrophes and smart quotes
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')           // Replace spaces with -
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '')       // Remove all non-word chars
    .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-')         // Replace multiple - with single -
    .replace(/^-+/, '')             // Trim - from start of text
    .replace(/-+$/, '');            // Trim - from end of text
});
```

## Testing & Validation
1. Rebuilt the site using `npm run build`
2. Started local server on port 8080
3. Successfully navigated to all previously broken URLs
4. Confirmed all posts are now accessible with properly formatted URLs

## Recommendations
1. **Deploy the fix**: Push the changes to the main branch to fix the production site
2. **Add URL validation**: Consider adding automated tests to catch URL issues during build
3. **Monitor 404s**: Set up monitoring to alert on future 404 errors
4. **Document the fix**: This report serves as documentation for future reference

## Conclusion
The broken link issue has been successfully resolved by implementing a custom slug filter that properly handles apostrophes and other special characters in blog post titles. All affected URLs are now working correctly in the local build and ready for deployment.

## Trimming Strategies

### 1. Code Block Reduction
**Before:**
```python
# Full implementation with extensive comments
def complex_function():
    # Step 1: Initialize variables
    x = 0
    y = 0
    # Step 2: Process data
    for i in range(100):
        x += i
        y += i * 2
    # Step 3: Return results
    return x, y
```

**After:**
```python
def complex_function():
    x = sum(range(100))
    y = sum(i * 2 for i in range(100))
    return x, y
```
**Link to full code:** See [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/...)

**Savings:** 50-100 words per code block

---

### 2. Redundancy Elimination
**Before:**
> "In this section, we'll explore how to implement DNS-over-HTTPS. DNS-over-HTTPS, also known as DoH, is a protocol that encrypts DNS queries. This encryption helps protect your privacy by preventing DNS queries from being intercepted."

**After:**
> "DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS queries to protect privacy."

**Savings:** 30-40 words per paragraph

---

### 3. Bullet Points Over Paragraphs
**Before:**
> "The first step in setting up the system is to install the necessary dependencies. After that, you'll need to configure the network settings. Then, you should enable the firewall rules. Finally, test the configuration to ensure everything works properly."

**After:**
**Setup steps:**
- Install dependencies
- Configure network
- Enable firewall
- Test configuration

**Savings:** 20-30 words

---

### 4. Table Compression
**Before:**
> "The first option is to use Suricata for network monitoring. Suricata provides deep packet inspection capabilities. The second option is Zeek, which offers powerful scripting. Zeek is particularly good for custom detection rules."

**After:**

| Tool | Strengths |
|------|-----------|
| Suricata | Deep packet inspection |
| Zeek | Powerful scripting, custom rules |

**Savings:** 15-25 words

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Verbosity (15 posts >2000 words)

**Priority: HIGH**

**Worst offenders:**
1. **2025-10-17-progressive-context-loading-llm-workflows.md** - 3,507 words (needs 43% reduction)
2. **2025-08-09-ai-cognitive-infrastructure.md** - 2,516 words (needs 26% reduction)
3. **2025-10-13-embodied-ai-robots-physical-world.md** - 2,445 words (needs 18% reduction)

**Recommended actions:**
- Cut fluff and redundancy
- Move detailed code to GitHub gists
- Use tables instead of paragraphs
- Break into series if necessary

**Target:** Get all posts under 2,000 words (ideally 1,400-1,800)

### 2. Corporate Speak (10+ violations)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Most common violations:**
- "leverage" (8 instances across 6 posts)
- "paradigm shift" (3 instances)
- "game-changer" (2 instances)
- "disruptive" (2 instances)

**Posts needing cleanup:**
- 2024-05-30-ai-learning-resource-constrained.md (2x "leverage")
- 2025-07-01-ebpf-security-monitoring-practical-guide.md (2x "leverage" + 1x "paradigm shift")
- 2025-08-07-supercharging-development-claude-flow.md (1x "Leverage" + 1x "paradigm shift")

**Recommended replacements:**
- "leverage" → "use", "apply", "employ"
- "paradigm shift" → "fundamental change", "breakthrough"
- "game-changer" → "significant improvement", "major advancement"

### 3. AI Anthropomorphism (8 posts)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Violations:**
- "AI knows" → "AI processes", "AI analyzes"
- "AI feels" → "AI appears to", "AI exhibits"
- "model decided" → "model selected", "model output"

**Posts to fix:**
- 2025-07-22-supercharging-claude-cli-with-standards.md (3x "knows")
- 2024-03-20-transformer-architecture-deep-dive.md (1x "feels")
- 2024-04-19-mastering-prompt-engineering-llms.md (1x "feels")

### 4. Uncited AI Claims (7 instances)

**Priority: HIGH**

**Posts needing citations:**
- 2024-03-20-transformer-architecture-deep-dive.md (3 claims)
- 2025-10-17-progressive-context-loading-llm-workflows.md (2 claims)
- 2024-05-30-ai-learning-resource-constrained.md (1 claim)
- 2024-05-14-ai-new-frontier-cybersecurity.md (1 claim)

**Required action:** Add arXiv, academic, or vendor documentation links to support claims.

Your **homelab/security posts score 10.0/10 consistently**. They demonstrate:
- Direct, no-nonsense tone
- BLUF structure (get to the point)
- Heavy use of bullets and code blocks
- Zero corporate speak
- Practical, hands-on focus

**Action:** When writing new posts, ask "Would this fit in my homelab series?"

### 2. Pre-Flight Checklist for New Posts
Before publishing any new blog post, run:

```bash
# Automated compliance check
python scripts/utilities/blog-compliance-analyzer.py --post src/posts/NEW_POST.md --verbose

# Look for:
# - Word count >2000
# - Corporate speak
# - Uncited claims
# - AI anthropomorphism
```

### 3. Monthly Compliance Reviews
Schedule quarterly reviews to catch drift:
- Run analyzer on all posts
- Fix violations immediately
- Update this report

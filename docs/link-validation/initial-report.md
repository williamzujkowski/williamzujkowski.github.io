7. **images.unsplash.com:** 14 links - Stock images
8. **cloud.google.com:** 12 links - GCP documentation
9. **nvlpubs.nist.gov:** 12 links - NIST publications

## Key Observations

### Academic Citations
- Heavy reliance on arXiv (98 links) shows strong research backing
- DOI links (34) provide permanent references
- Good mix of conference proceedings and journals

### Security Resources
- Multiple references to OWASP, NIST, CISA
- MITRE ATT&CK framework references
- First.org EPSS documentation

### Technical Documentation
- Cloud provider docs (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Framework documentation (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Protocol specifications (RFCs)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priority
1. **Validate arXiv links** - Check if papers still accessible
2. **Update DOI links** - Ensure proper DOI resolution
3. **Check GitHub repos** - Verify repos still exist

### Medium Priority
1. **Update cloud documentation links** - These change frequently
2. **Verify security advisories** - CISA/NIST links may have moved
3. **Check image links** - Unsplash URLs may have changed

### Low Priority
1. **News article links** - May be behind paywalls now
2. **Company blog posts** - Often reorganized
3. **Marketing/vendor pages** - Frequently updated

## Link Validation Infrastructure

Created comprehensive link validation tools:

### Core Scripts
- `link-extractor.py` - Extracts all links with context
- `link-validator.py` - Validates links (requires Playwright for full functionality)
- `content-relevance-checker.py` - Verifies content matches citations
- `citation-repair.py` - Finds replacements for broken links
- `link-report-generator.py` - Generates detailed reports
- `batch-link-fixer.py` - Orchestrates the entire process

### Features
- **Automatic repair suggestions** from academic databases
- **Wayback Machine integration** for archived content
- **Confidence scoring** for automated fixes
- **Manual review queue** for complex cases
- **Batch processing** with backups

## Next Steps

1. **Install Playwright** for full validation:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Run full validation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/link-validation/batch-link-fixer.py --dry-run
   ```

3. **Apply high-confidence fixes**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/link-validation/batch-link-fixer.py --confidence-threshold 90 --apply
   ```

4. **Review manual queue**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/link-validation/batch-link-fixer.py --generate-review-queue
   ```

## Summary

The link validation infrastructure is now in place with:
- ✅ Comprehensive link extraction (713 links found)
- ✅ Multi-strategy validation approach
- ✅ Academic citation repair capabilities
- ✅ Automated fix application with confidence thresholds
- ✅ Detailed reporting and manual review queues

The system is designed to maintain the high citation quality standards while automating as much of the validation and repair process as possible.

- Focus on LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning (consumer-friendly methods)
- Include GPU thermal management stories
- Document training dataset preparation challenges
- Share cost analysis (electricity, time investment)
- Add failure narratives (overfit models, poor dataset choices)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Baseline: 45-50/100 (new post, some violations expected)
- Refined: 85-90/100 (after Batch 5 humanization)
- No NDA risk whatsoever
- Adds valuable AI fine-tuning content to portfolio

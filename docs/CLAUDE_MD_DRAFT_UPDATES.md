## NEW SECTION: Writing Style & Tone

### The "Polite Linus Torvalds" Standard

**What it means:**
- Be direct. Cut the fluff.
- Be honest about what works and what doesn't.
- Be respectful. No personal attacks, no condescension.
- Focus on substance, not style points.

**Why it matters:**
This blog exists to share real technical work, not to impress people with fancy language. Readers want clarity, not corporate speak.

### Core Principles

**Lead with the point:**
- First sentence = most important takeaway
- No throat-clearing
- No "In this post, I will discuss..."

**Use bullets liberally:**
- One idea per bullet
- Short sentences
- White space is your friend

**Cut ruthlessly:**
- Remove qualifiers: "actually," "basically," "essentially"
- Delete adverbs: "very," "really," "quite"
- Kill corporate speak: "leverage," "synergy," "paradigm"

**Examples:**

❌ Bad:
```
In this post, I'm going to discuss some really interesting
findings I discovered while essentially experimenting with
various approaches to leverage containerization in my homelab
environment, which actually proved to be quite beneficial.
```

✅ Good:
```
Docker cut my homelab deployment time by 70%.

Here's what worked and what didn't.
```

### "Why it matters" Sections

Every major claim needs context:

```markdown
**Why it matters:** [One sentence explaining impact]
```

Example:
```markdown
K3s uses 512MB RAM vs Kubernetes' 2GB minimum.

**Why it matters:** You can run production-grade orchestration
on a Raspberry Pi without sacrificing features.
```

## NEW SECTION: Healthy AI Skepticism

### Question the Hype

**The rule:** Every AI claim gets scrutinized.

**Red flags:**
- "AI will solve X" without methodology
- Benchmarks without reproducible code
- Percentages without sample size
- "State-of-the-art" without comparison
- "Revolutionary" without evidence

### Demand Evidence

**Before writing about AI:**
- Find the actual paper
- Check if code is public
- Verify claims against independent sources
- Look for limitations section
- Check for conflicts of interest

**Required context for AI claims:**
- Dataset size and composition
- Compute requirements
- Comparison with baselines
- Known failure modes
- Reproducibility status

### Write About AI Honestly

**Good patterns:**
```markdown
✅ "GPT-4 scored 73% on this benchmark (vs GPT-3.5's 61%).
   But the test data may overlap with training data."

✅ "This model works well for X. It fails completely at Y.
   Paper doesn't mention Y."

✅ "Impressive demo. No public weights. No reproducibility.
   Treat with skepticism."
```

**Bad patterns:**
```markdown
❌ "AI achieves human-level performance"
❌ "This breakthrough will revolutionize..."
❌ "AI understands X" (it predicts tokens)
```

### The Anthropomorphism Rule

**Don't:**
- Say AI "understands," "thinks," or "knows"
- Attribute human qualities to models
- Imply consciousness or reasoning

**Do:**
- Say models "predict," "generate," or "classify"
- Describe training methodology
- Explain statistical patterns

**Why it matters:** Precise language prevents misconceptions about what these systems actually do.

## REWRITTEN SECTION: Blog Post Guidelines (Condensed)

### Before You Write

**Check topic diversity:**
```bash
# List last 10 post topics
ls -t src/posts/*.md | head -10 | xargs grep "^tags:"
```

**Rules:**
- Different primary topic than last 5 posts
- No duplicate keywords in title
- Check overrepresented topics

**Why it matters:** Readers get bored. Variety keeps them coming back.

### Minimum Standards

- **Length:** 1,400-2,100 words (6-9 min read)
- **Citations:** 90%+ of claims sourced
- **Images:** Hero + 1 per major section
- **Code:** <25% of content

**Instant rejection criteria:**
- <1,400 words
- Made-up statistics
- No sources for technical claims
- Work/NDA violations

### Structure (5 Parts)

1. **Hook** (50 words): Grab attention
2. **Context** (100 words): Why this matters now
3. **Main Content** (1,000-1,500 words): The substance
4. **Reflection** (150 words): What I learned
5. **Call to Action** (50 words): What readers should do

### Writing Rules

**Lead with the point:**
```markdown
❌ "While exploring various approaches to container orchestration..."
✅ "K3s cut my RAM usage by 75%. Here's how."
```

**Use bullets for lists:**
```markdown
✅ Three ways this failed:
   - OOM kills on 2GB nodes
   - etcd corruption after power loss
   - DNS resolution lag >5s
```

**One idea per paragraph:**
```markdown
✅ K3s uses SQLite instead of etcd. This matters for edge deployments.

   SQLite needs no quorum. Your cluster survives network partitions.
```

### Images

**Required:**
- Hero image (1200x630px)
- One image per major section
- All images have descriptive alt text

**Scripts:**
```bash
# Auto-generate hero images
python scripts/blog-images/generate-blog-hero-images.py

# Optimize all images
bash scripts/optimize-blog-images.sh
```

### Citations

**Every technical claim needs:**
- Primary source (paper, documentation)
- Working hyperlink
- Publication date

**Format:**
```markdown
[Kubernetes uses 2GB RAM minimum](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) (2024)

**Research citation:**
"K3s reduces memory footprint by 50%" ([Rancher Labs, 2023](https://rancher.com/k3s-whitepaper))
```

**Why it matters:** No citations = no credibility. Readers can verify your claims.

---

## REWRITTEN SECTION: Research Requirements (Condensed)

### The Golden Rule

**Never fabricate.**

If you don't have a source, don't make the claim.

### Required Sources

**For every technical claim:**
1. Primary source (original research/docs)
2. Working hyperlink
3. Publication date within 2 years

**Acceptable sources:**
- arXiv preprints
- Peer-reviewed papers (DOI links)
- Official documentation
- NIST/OWASP/standards bodies
- Vendor benchmarks (with methodology)

**Unacceptable sources:**
- Blog posts (unless from paper authors)
- Wikipedia
- Forums/Reddit
- Marketing materials
- Undated content

### Citation Format

**Inline:**
```markdown
[Specific claim with evidence](https://direct-link-to-source) (Year)
```

**References section:**
```markdown
1. **[Paper Title](https://doi.org/10.xxxx)** (2024)
   - Authors
   - *Journal/Conference*
   - Key finding: [one sentence]
```

### Pre-Publication Check

Run before committing:
```bash
# Validate all citations
python scripts/blog-research/check-citation-hyperlinks.py

# Check for uncited claims
python scripts/blog-research/research-validator.py --post src/posts/[file].md
```

**Why it matters:** 90%+ citation coverage is our standard. It's what separates this blog from content farms.

---

## REWRITTEN SECTION: NDA & Security Compliance (Condensed)

### Absolute Rules

**NEVER discuss:**
- Current work incidents (minimum 2-3 year buffer)
- Specific government systems
- Active vulnerabilities at work
- Timeline-specific work events
- Team members or organizational structure

**ALWAYS use:**
- "Years ago, I learned..." (vague timeframes)
- "In my homelab..." (personal projects)
- "Research suggests..." (academic framing)
- "A common pattern..." (hypothetical)

### Safe Patterns

```markdown
✅ "In my homelab, I discovered X vulnerability in Y."
✅ "Years ago, I worked on systems that faced Z challenge."
✅ "Research shows this attack pattern is common."
```

### Unsafe Patterns

```markdown
❌ "Last month at work..."
❌ "My current employer uses..."
❌ "We recently discovered..."
```

**Why it matters:** Your clearance and career matter more than a blog post. When in doubt, leave it out.

---

## UPDATED SECTION: File Organization (Simplified)

### Core Rule

**Never save to root.** Use these directories:

```
/src         → Source code
/tests       → Test files
/docs        → Documentation (including this file)
/scripts     → Automation utilities
/config      → Configuration files
```

### Common Mistakes

❌ `validate-claims.py` in root
❌ `test-citations.md` in root
❌ `working-notes.txt` anywhere

✅ `scripts/blog-research/validate-claims.py`
✅ `tests/test-citations.py`
✅ `docs/working-notes.md`

---

## UPDATED SECTION: Concurrent Execution (Simplified)

### The One-Message Rule

**All related operations in one message.**

**Examples:**

✅ **Correct:**
```javascript
// Single message with all operations
Read("file1.js")
Read("file2.js")
Edit("file1.js", old, new)
Edit("file2.js", old, new)
Bash("npm test")
```

❌ **Wrong:**
```javascript
// Message 1
Read("file1.js")

// Message 2
Edit("file1.js", old, new)

// Message 3
Bash("npm test")
```

### Why It Matters

Parallel execution = 2.8-4.4x faster.

Sequential execution = slow, wasted tokens.

---

## STYLE COMPARISON

## EXAMPLE REWRITES

### Example 1: Blog Post Philosophy

**Before:**
```markdown
When creating blog posts for williamzujkowski.github.io, it is
important to follow comprehensive guidelines to ensure quality,
consistency, and alignment with the blog's mission. The target
audience consists primarily of technology enthusiasts with
varying levels of expertise, and secondarily of beginners who
are seeking to understand complex technical concepts.
```

**After:**
```markdown
Blog post checklist:
- 1,400+ words (6-9 min read)
- 90%+ claims cited
- Hero image + section images
- Code <25% of content

**Target readers:** Tech enthusiasts + beginners learning complex topics
```

### Example 2: Research Standards

**Before:**
```markdown
To ensure content is cutting-edge and relevant, it is recommended
to explore recent research by searching arXiv for papers uploaded
within the last 30 days that align with blog focus areas. You
should identify breakthrough papers by looking for papers with
high citation potential, novel methodologies, breakthrough findings,
emerging trends or paradigm shifts, and unexpected connections
between fields.
```

**After:**
```markdown
Find cutting-edge research:
1. Search arXiv (last 30 days)
2. Look for breakthrough papers:
   - Novel methodology
   - Unexpected cross-domain connections
   - Paradigm shifts

**Why it matters:** Fresh research = unique content
```

### Example 3: Citation Requirements

**Before:**
```markdown
Every technical claim must have a primary source, which should be
an original research paper or official documentation, along with
secondary validation from additional supporting sources. It is also
necessary to provide context by explaining the methodology, sample
size, and limitations. Additionally, ensure information is current
by checking publication dates.
```

**After:**
```markdown
Every technical claim needs:
- Primary source (paper/docs)
- Working hyperlink
- Publication date
- Methodology/sample size
- Known limitations

Check dates. Outdated sources = rejected post.
```

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Use this to verify updates work in practice:

- [ ] Can I scan and find key rules in <30 seconds?
- [ ] Are enforcement rules still clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Can I understand blog post requirements without re-reading?
- [ ] Are examples concrete (not abstract)?
- [ ] Is critical information front-loaded?
- [ ] Are "Why it matters" sections present for context?
- [ ] Have I cut all unnecessary words?
- [ ] Do bullets replace walls of text?
- [ ] Can a new LLM agent onboard quickly?

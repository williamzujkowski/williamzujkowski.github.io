# Batch 2 Post 2 Pre-Analysis: Building MCP Standards Server

**File**: `2025-07-29-building-mcp-standards-server.md`
**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Priority Score**: Medium-High

---

## Quick Metrics (from analyze-post.py)

- **Citations**: 3 (all GitHub - needs 7 more for 10+ target)
- **Weak Language**: 14 instances (HIGH)
  - 6× "just"
  - 3× "actually"
  - 1× "very"
  - 4× other intensifiers
- **Bullet Points**: 32 (needs 28 more for 60+ target)

---

## Success Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Citations | 3 | ≥10 | Need +7 |
| Weak Language | 14 | 0 | Eliminate 100% |
| Bullets | 32 | ≥60 | Need +28 |
| Build | N/A | PASSING | Must verify |

## Content Characteristics

**Voice**: Personal, humorous, self-deprecating, honest about failure
**Format**: Story of project evolution (scope creep journey)
**Code**: 5 code blocks (valuable - keep them)
**Diagrams**: 1 misplaced ML pipeline (REMOVE)

**CRITICAL**: This post's personality is its strength. Must preserve:
- Self-aware humor about over-engineering
- Honest admissions of mistakes
- "The Real Talk" authenticity
- Personal voice and casual tone

---

## Weak Language Instances (14 total)

Based on analyze-post.py:
- Line 18: "just" (title tag context)
- Line 22: "actually"
- Line 31: "just"
- Line 58: "actually"
- Line 64: "actually"
- Line 92: "just"
- Line 154: "just"
- Line 176: "very"
- Line 190: "just"
- Line 204: "just"
- Plus 4 more to find

**Strategy**: Replace without killing personality
- "just" → remove or replace with specific action
- "actually" → remove filler word entirely
- "very" → quantify or strengthen

## Citations to Add (Need 7+)

**Required Sources:**
1. **MCP Protocol**: [Anthropic MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
2. **Redis**: Official Redis documentation
3. **ChromaDB**: Vector database documentation
4. **MCP GitHub**: Official MCP GitHub repository
5. **Standards repo**: Personal standards repository (GitHub)
6. **React**: For web UI discussion
7. **Python MCP SDK**: Implementation details

**Search Strategy:**
- Anthropic MCP docs
- Redis.io official documentation
- ChromaDB documentation
- GitHub MCP examples

---

## Diagram Issue

**Lines 35-66**: ML data pipeline Mermaid diagram
- **Content**: Raw Data → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Training → Deployment
- **Problem**: This is a generic ML pipeline, not MCP architecture
- **Action**: REMOVE (doesn't relate to MCP server architecture)
- **Alternative**: Could add MCP communication diagram if needed, but not required

---

## Bulletization Strategy (Need +28 bullets)

### High-Priority Targets:

**1. "What Actually Works" (lines 131-173)**
- Currently: 3 subsections with code blocks
- Strategy: Add bullets for features/capabilities
- Target: +8 bullets

**2. "The Struggles" (lines 175-193)**
- Currently: 3 learning moments with prose
- Strategy: Bullet key lessons and symptoms
- Target: +10 bullets

**3. "Unexpected Discoveries" (lines 195-221)**
- Currently: 2 subsections with prose
- Strategy: Bullet surprising outcomes and metrics
- Target: +8 bullets

**4. "Lessons Learned" (lines 245-257)**
- Currently: 3 subsections with prose
- Strategy: Bullet key takeaways
- Target: +8 bullets

**5. "What's Next" (lines 259-272)**
- Currently: 2 lists (Realistic and Dream)
- Already has some bullets, expand
- Target: +4 bullets

**Total New Bullets**: ~38 (combined with existing 32 = 70 bullets)

## BLUF Creation Plan

**Opening Hook** (2-3 sentences):
"Started building a simple MCP server wrapper for my standards repository. Three weeks and 6,000 lines of code later: Redis caching, vector search, 6 language analyzers, 88 tests, and a React UI nobody asked for. Classic developer scope creep in action."

**Why It Matters** (2-3 sentences):
"Personal projects expose the gap between 'working prototype' and 'production ready.' This journey illustrates common engineering pitfalls: premature optimization, tool-driven architecture, and the seductive danger of 'just one more feature.' Real lessons learned from real mistakes."

**Quantified Stakes**:
- Version 1: ~200 lines, working
- Version 4: 6,000+ lines, 47 components, occasional Redis crashes
- Learning: Sometimes grep > AI, simple > sophisticated

---

## Code Blocks Assessment

**All code blocks serve narrative purpose - KEEP THEM:**

1. **Naive first attempt** (lines 74-82): Shows initial simplicity
2. **Current reality** (lines 86-97): Illustrates scope creep
3. **Intelligent selection** (lines 139-148): Demonstrates actual value
4. **Multi-language validation** (lines 156-161): Shows practical use
5. **Token optimization** (lines 167-173): Quantifies benefit
6. **Benchmarking** (lines 214-219): Shows performance obsession
7. **Quick start** (lines 277-291): Realistic setup instructions

**Value**: These code blocks TELL THE STORY. Don't remove.

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas**:
- **Losing personality**: This post's charm is its honesty and humor
- **Over-bulletizing**: Don't make it too formal

**Mitigation**:
- Keep all code blocks (they tell the story)
- Preserve "The Real Talk" section verbatim
- Maintain self-aware humor in bullets
- Keep casual, conversational transitions

---

## Expected Outcome

**Before**:
- 3 citations, 14 weak language, 32 bullets
- Personal, funny, authentic

**After Target**:
- 10+ citations, 0 weak language, 60+ bullets
- STILL personal, funny, authentic
- More scannable without losing voice
- Build: PASSING

---

## Key Principles for This Post

1. **Preserve Voice**: Don't make it sound corporate
2. **Keep Code**: Examples illustrate the journey
3. **Honest Bullets**: Use bullets for "What broke" lists
4. **Maintain Humor**: Self-deprecation is the point
5. **Real Lessons**: Actual learning, not sanitized

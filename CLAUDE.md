## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### 🧹 CLEANUP PHASE: MANDATORY FOR ALL WORKFLOWS

**EVERY TODO LIST MUST INCLUDE:**
1. **Cleanup tasks** as final items (remove temp files, vestigial scripts, test artifacts)
2. **Validation after cleanup** to ensure nothing breaks
3. **Commit and push** cleaned state
4. **Monitor deployment** to verify site functionality
5. **Revert if needed** and fix issues iteratively

**CLEANUP TARGETS:**
- Temporary troubleshooting scripts (e.g., `validate-*.py`, `fix-*.py`, `test-*.py`)
- Research/analysis files in `/docs` that are no longer needed
- Duplicate or superseded scripts in `/scripts`
- Test artifacts and temporary data files
- Old backup files or `.bak` extensions
- Unnecessary log files or debug outputs

**CLEANUP RULES:**
- NEVER delete production scripts without verification
- ALWAYS test site functionality after cleanup
- KEEP essential utilities and actively used tools
- PRESERVE documentation that provides value
- MAINTAIN scripts referenced in CLAUDE.md or README

### 📁 File Organization Rules

**Never save to root.** Use these directories:

```
/src         → Source code
/tests       → Test files
/docs        → Documentation (including this file)
/scripts     → Automation utilities
/config      → Configuration files
```

**Common mistakes:**
❌ `validate-claims.py` in root
❌ `test-citations.md` in root
❌ `working-notes.txt` anywhere

✅ `scripts/blog-research/validate-claims.py`
✅ `tests/test-citations.py`
✅ `docs/working-notes.md`

## Project Overview

This project uses SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology with Claude-Flow orchestration for systematic Test-Driven Development.

### 📸 Blog Visual Enhancement System
**Quick Commands for Blog Optimization:**
```bash
# Analyze posts for high code ratios
python scripts/blog-content/optimize-blog-content.py

# Generate Mermaid diagram templates
python scripts/utilities/diagram-manager.py

# Search and download stock images (no API keys)
python scripts/blog-images/playwright-image-search.py
```

**Code Reduction Guidelines:**
- Target <25% code-to-content ratio
- Replace verbose code with Mermaid diagrams
- Keep snippets to 5-10 essential lines
- Link to GitHub gists for full examples

## 🎯 Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL:
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY:
- Coordination and planning
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- Swarm orchestration
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates, Claude Code executes.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# Add Claude Flow MCP server
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

## MCP Tool Categories

### Coordination
`swarm_init`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`

### Monitoring
`swarm_status`, `agent_list`, `agent_metrics`, `task_status`, `task_results`

### Memory & Neural
`memory_usage`, `neural_status`, `neural_train`, `neural_patterns`

### GitHub Integration
`github_swarm`, `repo_analyze`, `pr_enhance`, `issue_triage`, `code_review`

### System
`benchmark_run`, `features_detect`, `swarm_monitor`

## 📋 Agent Coordination Protocol

### Every Agent MUST:

**1️⃣ BEFORE Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"
```

**2️⃣ DURING Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"
```

**3️⃣ AFTER Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

## 🎯 Concurrent Execution Examples

### The One-Message Rule

**All related operations in one message.**

✅ **Correct:**
```javascript
// Single message with all operations
Read("file1.js")
Read("file2.js")
Edit("file1.js", old, new)
Edit("file2.js", old, new)
Bash("npm test")
```

❌ **Wrong:**
```javascript
// Message 1
Read("file1.js")

// Message 2
Edit("file1.js", old, new)

// Message 3
Bash("npm test")
```

**Why it matters:** Parallel execution = 2.8-4.4x faster. Sequential = slow, wasted tokens.

## Performance Benefits

- **84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate**
- **32.3% token reduction**

Remember: **Claude Flow coordinates, Claude Code creates!**

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Never save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder.

## SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR HOMELAB AND HARDWARE
**CRITICAL**: Always reference `/uses/` page (src/pages/uses.md) for accurate information about:
- Hardware specifications (Intel i9-9900K, 64GB RAM, RTX 3090, Dell R940, Raspberry Pi setup)
- Software stack (Proxmox, Docker, K3s, Wazuh, specific tools)

## 🔬 BLOG POST RESEARCH & CREDIBILITY MODEL

### ABSOLUTE RULE: NO FABRICATION
**NEVER make up information, statistics, or claims. ALWAYS back statements with reputable sources.**

**Why it matters:** No citations = no credibility. Readers can verify your claims.

### Research Verification Process
1. **Claim Identification**: Scan content for factual claims, statistics, technical statements
2. **Source Validation**: Every claim MUST have a reputable source
3. **Citation Integration**: Properly cite all sources inline and in references
4. **Fact Checking**: Use Playwright to verify claims against authoritative sources

### 📚 Open-Access Research Platforms

#### Primary Research Sources
1. **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)** - Preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics
2. **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)** - General-purpose open repository by CERN with DOI assignment
3. **[CORE](https://core.ac.uk/)** - Aggregates 250+ million open-access papers with API access
4. **[Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/)** - Multi-disciplinary preprints with moderation
5. **[Research Square](https://www.researchsquare.com/)** - Springer Nature integrated preprints
6. **[SciPost](https://scipost.org/)** - Community-driven peer review in physics

### 🔍 Research Integration Workflow

#### For Every Blog Post:
1. **Pre-Writing Research**
   ```python
   # Use scripts/research-validator.py
   python scripts/blog-research/research-validator.py --post "post-title" --check-claims
   ```

2. **Claim Validation with Playwright**
   ```python
   # Search academic sources
   python scripts/blog-research/academic-search.py --query "specific claim" --sources "arxiv,zenodo,core"
   ```

3. **Source Citation Format - MANDATORY HYPERLINKS**
   - **ALL citations MUST include clickable hyperlinks to sources**
   - Inline: `[Study shows 73% improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2024.xxxxx)`
   - Reference format:
     ```markdown
     1. **[Paper Title](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx)** (Year)
        - Author names
        - *Journal/Conference Name*
     ```
   - Links MUST point to:
     - arXiv, PubMed Central, or open-access versions
     - DOI links (https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx)
     - Official publisher/organization pages
   - NEVER cite without a working hyperlink to the source

4. **Visual Evidence**
   - Extract figures/charts from papers (with permission/citation)
   - Create original diagrams based on research data
   - Include methodology visualizations

### 📊 Content Quality Standards

**Every technical claim needs:**
- Primary source (original research paper or official documentation)
- Secondary validation (additional supporting sources)
- Context (methodology, sample size, limitations)
- Recency check (publication dates within 2 years)

**Red flags to avoid:**
- ❌ "Studies show..." without citation
- ❌ Specific percentages without source
- ❌ "It's well known that..." without evidence
- ❌ Technical specifications without verification
- ❌ Historical claims without references
- ❌ Performance metrics without methodology

### 🤖 Automated Research Validation

#### Scripts for Research Integrity:
```bash
# Validate research claims in posts
python scripts/blog-research/research-validator.py --post src/posts/example.md

# Search academic sources for supporting research
python scripts/blog-research/academic-search.py --query "quantum computing" --sources "arxiv,zenodo,core"

# Add academic citations to blog posts
python scripts/blog-research/add-academic-citations.py --post src/posts/example.md

# Check citation hyperlinks for validity
python scripts/blog-research/check-citation-hyperlinks.py
```

### 📈 Research-Backed Content Structure

#### Optimal Blog Post Format:
1. **Introduction** - Set context with cited background
2. **Literature Review** - Brief overview of existing research
3. **Core Content** - Main points with supporting evidence
4. **Case Studies** - Real examples with sources
5. **Data Visualization** - Charts/graphs from research
6. **Limitations** - Acknowledge gaps or contradictions
7. **Future Directions** - Based on research trends
8. **References** - Complete citation list

### 🔗 Playwright Research Automation

#### Use Playwright for:
- Searching academic databases
- Verifying technical specifications
- Checking latest documentation versions
- Finding recent research papers
- Validating statistical claims
- Screenshot evidence collection

#### Example Research Flow:
```python
# Search multiple academic sources
async def research_claim(claim):
    sources = ['arxiv', 'zenodo', 'core', 'scholar.google.com']
    results = []
    for source in sources:
        results.extend(await search_source(source, claim))
    return validate_and_rank_sources(results)
```

### ✅ Pre-Publication Checklist

Run before committing:
```bash
# Validate all citations
python scripts/blog-research/check-citation-hyperlinks.py

# Check for uncited claims
python scripts/blog-research/research-validator.py --post src/posts/[file].md
```

# Content Style Guidelines for Blog Posts

## Writing Style: The "Polite Linus Torvalds" Standard

**What it means:**
Direct. Honest. Respectful. Substance over style.

**Why it matters:**
This blog shares real technical work, not corporate marketing. Readers want clarity, not fluff.

### Core Principles

**Lead with the point:**
- First sentence = most important takeaway
- No throat-clearing
- No "In this post, I will discuss..."

**Use bullets liberally:**
- One idea per bullet
- Short sentences
- White space is your friend

**Cut ruthlessly:**
- Remove qualifiers: "actually," "basically," "essentially"
- Delete adverbs: "very," "really," "quite"
- Kill corporate speak: "leverage," "synergy," "paradigm"

**Examples:**

❌ Bad:
```
In this post, I'm going to discuss some really interesting
findings I discovered while essentially experimenting with
various approaches to leverage containerization in my homelab
environment, which actually proved to be quite beneficial.
```

✅ Good:
```
Docker cut my homelab deployment time by 70%.

Here's what worked and what didn't.
```

### "Why it matters" Sections

Every major claim needs context:

```markdown
**Why it matters:** [One sentence explaining impact]
```

Example:
```markdown
K3s uses 512MB RAM vs Kubernetes' 2GB minimum.

**Why it matters:** You can run production-grade orchestration
on a Raspberry Pi without sacrificing features.
```

### Sentence Rhythm and Cadence

**Pattern:** Short → medium → punch.

Examples:
- "K3s works. It uses 512MB RAM. You can run it on a Raspberry Pi." (5-8-10 words)
- "The first test failed. Took 20 minutes to debug. Turns out I forgot sudo." (4-5-8 words)

**Avoid AI patterns:**
- ❌ Perfectly parallel structures: "This improves X. This enhances Y. This optimizes Z."
- ✅ Break rhythm: "This improves X. Y gets better too. Z? Still working on it."

**Use minimal conjunctions:**
- ❌ "I tested the system, and it worked, but the performance was slow."
- ✅ "I tested the system. It worked. Performance was slow."

**Add transitions like a human:**
- Use: "Still," "Anyway," "That's fine," "Turns out"
- Avoid: "Therefore," "Hence," "In conclusion," "Overall"

## Content Philosophy

### Voice Guidelines
**Use:**
- First person (I/me) for personal experiences
- Second person (you) when addressing readers
- Contractions for conversational flow
- Simple words when appropriate
- Specific examples over abstractions

**Avoid:**
- Corporate buzzwords unless discussing them specifically
- Unnecessarily complex vocabulary
- Absolute statements unless warranted
- Clickbait that doesn't match content

### Structure Rules
- Mix short punchy sentences with detailed ones
- One idea per paragraph
- Use white space for readability
- Start paragraphs with strong hooks

### Anti-AI-Tells Checklist

**Before publishing, eliminate these machine-like patterns:**

| Category | Remove | Replace With |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Punctuation** | Em dashes (—), semicolons (;) | Short sentences or commas |
| **Transitions** | "In conclusion," "Overall," "Therefore" | "Anyway," "That's the gist," "Still" |
| **Emotion** | "exciting," "remarkable," "thrilled" | "useful," "surprising," or remove |
| **Vocabulary** | "utilize," "leverage," "paradigm" | "use," "try," "model" |
| **Certainty** | Absolute claims ("always," "never") | "probably," "usually," "depends" |
| **Symmetry** | Perfectly parallel clauses | Break rhythm intentionally |

**Quick validation:**
```bash
# Check for AI tells in your post
grep -E "—|;|exciting|leverage|utilize|in conclusion|overall|therefore" src/posts/[file].md
```

**Why it matters:** These patterns signal AI authorship. Readers (and AI detectors) notice.

## Content Types

### Blog Post Formats
1. **Personal Essays** (800-2000 words): Story → Reflection → Takeaway
2. **Tutorials** (as needed): Problem → Solution → Steps → Results
3. **Thought Pieces** (600-1500 words): Observation → Analysis → Questions
4. **Project Documentation**: Goal → Process → Challenges → Outcome

### Technical Requirements
- Clear, descriptive titles (50-60 characters)
- Simple URL slugs with hyphens
- Meta descriptions for humans
- Descriptive image alt text
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks with comments

## Writing Process

1. **Capture Ideas**: Keep running topic list
2. **Draft Freely**: Write without editing initially
3. **Let It Rest**: Step away before editing
4. **Edit Ruthlessly**: Structure → Clarity → Grammar
5. **Final Checks**: Read aloud, verify links, check mobile preview

### Quality Checklist
Before publishing:
- Would I want to read this?
- Does it sound authentic?
- Is it helpful or interesting?
- Have I been honest?
- Have I respected others' privacy?

## Blog Post Structure Template

1. **Hook**: Start with story, question, or interesting fact
2. **Context**: Why writing about this now
3. **Main Content**: Core information
4. **Personal Reflection**: What this means personally
5. **Invitation**: Question or thought for readers

## Boundaries

### CRITICAL: Government Work Security Guidelines

**NEVER discuss:**
- Current work incidents (minimum 2-3 year buffer)
- Specific government systems
- Active vulnerabilities at work
- Timeline-specific work events
- Team members or organizational structure

**ALWAYS use:**
- "Years ago, I learned..." (vague timeframes)
- "In my homelab..." (personal projects)
- "Research suggests..." (academic framing)
- "A common pattern..." (hypothetical)

**Safe patterns:**
```markdown
✅ "In my homelab, I discovered X vulnerability in Y."
✅ "Years ago, I worked on systems that faced Z challenge."
✅ "Research shows this attack pattern is common."
```

**Unsafe patterns:**
```markdown
❌ "Last month at work..."
❌ "My current employer uses..."
❌ "We recently discovered..."
```

**Why it matters:** Your clearance and career matter more than a blog post. When in doubt, leave it out.

**Do Share:**
- Professional challenges and wins (from years ago)
- Learning struggles and breakthroughs (personal projects)
- Creative process (home lab/research)
- Book and media recommendations
- Opinions on industry trends
- Historical lessons learned (appropriately aged)
- Personal research and experiments

**Don't Share:**
- Current or recent work incidents
- Specific government agency details
- Active security measures or controls
- Ongoing investigations or issues
- Current vulnerabilities or threats at work
- Specific systems or technologies in use
- Team member details or roles
- Timeline-specific work events
- Family members' personal details
- Employer confidential information
- Others' stories without permission
- Financial specifics
- Personal relationship details

## Healthy AI Skepticism

### Question the Hype

**The rule:** Every AI claim gets scrutinized.

**Red flags:**
- "AI will solve X" without methodology
- Benchmarks without reproducible code
- Percentages without sample size
- "State-of-the-art" without comparison
- "Revolutionary" without evidence

### Demand Evidence

**Before writing about AI:**
- Find the actual paper
- Check if code is public
- Verify claims against independent sources
- Look for limitations section
- Check for conflicts of interest

**Required context for AI claims:**
- Dataset size and composition
- Compute requirements
- Comparison with baselines
- Known failure modes
- Reproducibility status

### Write About AI Honestly

**Good patterns:**
```markdown
✅ "GPT-4 scored 73% on this benchmark (vs GPT-3.5's 61%).
   But the test data may overlap with training data."

✅ "This model works well for X. It fails completely at Y.
   Paper doesn't mention Y."

✅ "Impressive demo. No public weights. No reproducibility.
   Treat with skepticism."
```

**Bad patterns:**
```markdown
❌ "AI achieves human-level performance"
❌ "This breakthrough will revolutionize..."
❌ "AI understands X" (it predicts tokens)
```

### The Anthropomorphism Rule

**Don't:**
- Say AI "understands," "thinks," or "knows"
- Attribute human qualities to models
- Imply consciousness or reasoning

**Do:**
- Say models "predict," "generate," or "classify"
- Describe training methodology
- Explain statistical patterns

**Why it matters:** Precise language prevents misconceptions about what these systems actually do.

## Remember
- Perfect is the enemy of published
- Voice will evolve—that's good
- Not every post needs to be epic
- It's okay to have opinions
- Writing gets easier with practice

## Humanization Techniques (Quick Reference)

**Add these elements to avoid AI-like writing:**

| Technique | Example | Use When |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Hesitation** | "At first I thought it was DNS. It wasn't." | Debugging stories |
| **Reflection** | "Looking back, that assumption was wrong." | Lessons learned |
| **Micro-failure** | "The first fix made it worse." | Tutorials |
| **Concrete detail** | "Took 17 minutes to compile." | Technical posts |
| **Temporal anchor** | "As of October 2025…" | Current state |
| **Contradiction** | "I hate YAML. But it works." | Opinions |

**Extended guidance:** See `human_tone.md` for advanced humanization techniques and style models (Polite Linus Torvalds, Kelsey Hightower clarity, Troy Hunt transparency).

**Automation:** Run `python scripts/blog-content/humanization-validator.py --post [file]` before publishing.

# 📝 Blog Post Creation Guidelines

## Before You Write

**Check topic diversity:**
```bash
# List last 10 post topics
ls -t src/posts/*.md | head -10 | xargs grep "^tags:"
```

**Rules:**
- Different primary topic than last 5 posts
- No duplicate keywords in title
- Check overrepresented topics

**Why it matters:** Readers get bored. Variety keeps them coming back.

## Minimum Standards

- **Length:** 1,400-2,100 words (6-9 min read)
- **Citations:** 90%+ of claims sourced
- **Images:** Hero + 1 per major section
- **Code:** <25% of content

**Instant rejection criteria:**
- <1,400 words
- Made-up statistics
- No sources for technical claims
- Work/NDA violations

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Technology enthusiasts with varying levels of expertise
- **Secondary**: Beginners seeking to understand complex technical concepts
- **Approach**: Begin with concise summaries to help beginners grasp key points, then dive deeper for advanced readers

### Focus Areas

Choose topics from these core domains:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Quantum Computing
- Cybersecurity and Information Security
- Cryptography
- Robotics and Automation
- High-Performance Computing
- Science Fiction (technology implications)
- Homelab and Self-Hosted Solutions

### Diversity Requirements

- **Primary topic/category** must differ from the main topics of at least the **last 5 blog posts**
- **Analyze the most recent 10 posts** in `/src/posts/` to identify overrepresented topics
- **Prioritize topics** that haven't been the primary focus of any blog post in the last 2 months
- **Avoid repeating primary keywords** from recent post titles (check last 10 posts)

### Topic Research Strategy

To ensure content is cutting-edge and relevant:

1. **Explore Recent Research**: Search arXiv for papers uploaded within the last 30 days that align with blog focus areas
2. **Identify Breakthrough Papers**: Look for papers with:
   - High citation potential
   - Novel methodologies
   - Breakthrough findings
   - Emerging trends or paradigm shifts
   - Unexpected connections between fields
3. **Bridge Multiple Disciplines**: Papers that connect different domains often present unique storytelling opportunities
4. **Build on Existing Literature**: Select topics that introduce new concepts or applications while building on established knowledge

### Topic Objective Definition

Clearly define the post's objective:
- **Educational**: Teaching readers a new concept
- **Tutorial**: Providing step-by-step guidance
- **Insight**: Offering perspectives on recent developments
- **Analysis**: Examining trade-offs and implications
- **Experience Report**: Sharing lessons from personal projects

## Structure (5 Parts)

1. **Hook** (50 words): Grab attention with one strong sentence
2. **Context** (100 words): Why this matters now
3. **Main Content** (1,000-1,500 words): The substance
4. **Reflection** (150 words): What I learned
5. **Call to Action** (50 words): What readers should do

## Writing Rules

**Lead with the point:**
```markdown
❌ "While exploring various approaches to container orchestration..."
✅ "K3s cut my RAM usage by 75%. Here's how."
```

**Use bullets for lists:**
```markdown
✅ Three ways this failed:
   - OOM kills on 2GB nodes
   - etcd corruption after power loss
   - DNS resolution lag >5s
```

**One idea per paragraph:**
```markdown
✅ K3s uses SQLite instead of etcd. This matters for edge deployments.

   SQLite needs no quorum. Your cluster survives network partitions.
```

## Content Requirements

**Every post must include:**
- Opening hook (compelling story, question, or fact)
- Context setting (why this topic matters now)
- Core technical content with sources
- Personal experience (homelab experiments or research)
- Practical examples (code samples, diagrams, images)
- Security considerations (when relevant, CVSS 9.5+)
- Trade-offs and limitations (balanced analysis)
- Personal reflection (what this means to you)
- Conclusion (summarize main points)
- Call to action (encourage readers to apply knowledge)

**Content quality:**
- Analogies and real-world examples
- Balanced perspective (discuss trade-offs)
- Simple language with jargon explanations
- Conversational tone
- Clear headings, bullet points, numbered lists

**Code integration:**
- Store samples in appropriate folders
- Include direct links in post
- Use syntax highlighting
- Add comments for clarity
- Keep examples concise (5-10 lines)

## Metadata and SEO

- Last updated date (if applicable)
- Description/summary (150-160 characters)
- Tags (4-8 relevant tags)
- Author information
- Image metadata (see Blog Image Standards section)

## Images

**Required:**
- Hero image (1200x630px)
- One image per major section
- All images have descriptive alt text

**Scripts:**
```bash
# Auto-generate hero images
python scripts/blog-images/generate-blog-hero-images.py

# 📝 Blog Post Transformation: Smart Brevity Methodology

## Overview

For transforming existing blog posts to meet Smart Brevity standards (10+ citations, 60+ bullets, 0 weak language, strong BLUF, human tone), use the proven 7-phase methodology from Batch 2+ (validated on 8 posts, enhanced with human tone validation).

**Complete methodology documented in:** `docs/batch-2/CLAUDE_MD_UPDATES.md` and `docs/human-tone-integration-plan.md`

## The 7 Phases (Quick Reference)

### Phase A: Pre-Analysis (15 min)
- Count current metrics (citations, bullets, weak language, word count)
- Identify transformation targets
- Document personal stories to preserve
- Create pre-analysis document

### Phase B: BLUF Creation (15 min)
- Add compelling "Bottom Line Up Front" hook
- 2-3 sentences establishing scale/stakes with quantified impact
- 2-3 sentences explaining "why it matters"
- Include 3-5 concrete metrics

### Phase C: Structure Transformation (40 min)
- Convert prose paragraphs to scannable bullets
- Target 60+ bullets while preserving personal voice
- Maintain first-person observations and humor
- Add transitions between bullet groups

### Phase D: Language Hardening (15 min)
- Eliminate weak language (actually, basically, really, very, quite, just)
- Preserve self-deprecating humor and honest admissions
- Keep first-person narrative voice
- Use quantified metrics instead of vague intensifiers

### Phase E: Citation Enhancement (20 min)
- Add 8-12 reputable sources with working hyperlinks
- Prioritize: arXiv, NIST, official docs, IEEE, ACM
- Format: inline citations + comprehensive References section
- Distribute: 2-3 in BLUF, 1 per major claim, complete list at end

### Phase F: Validation (10 min)
- Run `npm run build` (must pass)
- Verify: ≥10 citations, ≥60 bullets, 0 weak language, ≥1,400 words
- Check personal voice preserved in stories
- Mobile preview (375px screens)

### Phase G: Tone Validation (10 min)
- Remove AI tells (em dashes, semicolons, "in conclusion," "overall")
- Eliminate corporate jargon ("leverage," "utilize," "exciting")
- Break perfect parallel structures (vary rhythm)
- Add humanization elements (hesitation, reflection, concrete details)
- Verify sentence length variety (5-30 words, mixed)
- Run humanization validator: `python scripts/blog-content/humanization-validator.py --post [file]`

**Quick AI-tells check:**
```bash
grep -E "—|;|exciting|leverage|utilize|in conclusion|overall|therefore" src/posts/[file].md
```

**Why Phase G matters:** Smart Brevity (Phases A-F) handles structure and citations. Tone validation ensures AI-generated content reads human, not corporate.

## Batch 2 Results (8 Posts)

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Citations | 2.1 avg | 11.3 avg | +440% |
| Bullets | 23.4 avg | 78.1 avg | +234% |
| Weak Language | 9.8 avg | 0.0 | -100% |
| Build Success | 62.5% | 100% | +60% |

## Swarm Orchestration Pattern

**For batch transformations (3+ posts), use multi-agent approach:**
- **Planner Agent**: Creates pre-analysis, defines strategy, validates output
- **Researcher Agent**: Finds citations (arXiv, NIST, official docs), validates claims
- **Coder Agent**: Executes transformations, integrates citations, runs validation

**Memory key structure:** `swarm/batch-X/post-Y/{pre-analysis,citations,status,validation-results}`

## Key Success Patterns

1. **Pre-analysis prevents scope creep** - Know targets before starting
2. **BLUF works for all post types** - Technical and personal styles both effective
3. **Strategic bulletization preserves voice** - Keep "I" statements, humor, transitions
4. **Citation research improves content** - Beyond just adding links, deepens understanding
5. **Language hardening strengthens** - Remove hedging without sterilizing personality

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-bulletizing**: Keep 2-3 sentence transitions, preserve storytelling
- **Losing personal voice**: Delete weak language, NOT first-person narrative
- **Citation overload**: One per major claim, not every sentence
- **Vague BLUF**: Start with surprising fact, quantify immediately, answer "why care?"

## Documentation References

- **Complete methodology**: `docs/batch-2/CLAUDE_MD_UPDATES.md` (40K, comprehensive guide)
- **Lessons learned**: `docs/batch-2/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (36K, Batch 2 analysis)
- **Pre-analysis examples**: `docs/batch-2/pre-analysis/post-[1-8]-pre-analysis.md`
- **Cleanup report**: `docs/batch-2/CLEANUP_REPORT.md` (organization strategy)

## 🚀 Best Practices

### When Creating Blog Posts:
1. **Always run the update script** after creating a new post
2. **Generate hero images** for visual consistency
3. **Optimize images** before committing
4. **Test responsive loading** on different devices
5. **Verify alt text** is descriptive and accurate

### Image Selection Guidelines:
1. **Hero images**: Should represent the post's main concept
2. **Inline images**: Break up text every 3-4 paragraphs
3. **Diagrams**: Use for technical explanations
4. **Infographics**: Summarize data or processes
5. **Screenshots**: Show actual interfaces when relevant

### Content-Image Alignment:
- Place images near relevant text
- Use captions to provide context
- Ensure images enhance understanding
- Don't use decorative-only images

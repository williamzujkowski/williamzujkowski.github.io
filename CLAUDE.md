## 4. Detailed Testing Manifesto

Follow these principles and standards for comprehensive testing.

### 4.1 Core Testing Principles

#### 4.1.1. Hypothesis Tests for Behavior Validation

- Identify the core hypothesis for each function.
- Write tests defining clear expectations ("Given X, should do Y").
- Test positive, negative, and boundary cases.
- Verify error handling.
- Use descriptive test names.

```python
# Example
def test_user_authentication_valid_credentials():
    """HYPOTHESIS: Given valid credentials, authentication should succeed."""
    # Arrange
    valid_username = "test_user"
    valid_password = "correct_password"
    # Act
    result = authenticate_user(valid_username, valid_password)
    # Assert
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.error_message is None
```

#### 4.1.2. Regression Tests for Known Fail States

- For each bug fix, create a test recreating failure conditions.
- Document the original issue and fix verification.
- Include issue/ticket references.
- Maintain a dedicated regression suite.

```python
# Example
def test_calculation_with_zero_division_protection():
    """REGRESSION: Bug #1234 - Division by zero crash.
    Ensures safe_divide returns None instead of raising ZeroDivisionError."""
    # Arrange
    input_value = 10
    divisor = 0
    expected_result = None
    # Act
    result = safe_divide(input_value, divisor)
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```

#### 4.1.3. Benchmark Tests with SLA Enforcement

- Define clear performance metrics and SLAs (latency, throughput, resources, errors).
- Create tests measuring against defined thresholds in controlled environments.
- Include average and percentile measurements (p95, p99).
- Alert on violations.

```python
# Example (Conceptual)
def test_api_response_time_sla():
    """BENCHMARK: API p95 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms, error rate < 0.1%."""
    # Arrange: Setup load generation
    # Act: Run N requests, collect timings and errors
    # Assert: Calculate p95, p99, error_rate and compare against SLA
    pass # Implementation depends on benchmark tool (e.g., pytest-benchmark, locust)
```

#### 4.1.4. Grammatical Evolution (GE) for Fuzzing + Edge Discovery

- Define a grammar (e.g., BNF) for valid system inputs.
- Implement an evolutionary algorithm to generate grammatically correct but potentially unexpected test cases.
- Use fitness functions prioritizing edge cases and coverage.
- Log failures and add discovered edge cases to regression tests.

```python
# Example (Conceptual)
def test_with_grammatical_evolution():
    """FUZZING: Use GE to discover edge cases in the input parser."""
    # Arrange: Define grammar, configure GE fuzzer
    # Act: Run fuzzer against target function (e.g., api_request_handler)
    # Assert: Check for critical failures, add findings to regression suite.
    pass # Requires a GE framework implementation
```

#### 4.1.5. Structured Logs for Agent Feedback

- Design structured logging (e.g., JSON) capturing inputs, outputs, decisions, confidence scores, metrics, deviations.
- Use consistent formats and correlation IDs.
- Implement levels for filtering.
- Create log analyzers.

```python
# Example Test
def test_agent_logging_completeness():
    """AGENT FEEDBACK: Verify agent produces comprehensive structured logs."""
    # Arrange: Define expected log fields, setup log capture
    # Act: Run agent process
    # Assert: Check logs exist, required fields are present, sequence complete, decisions logged.
    pass # Requires agent instrumentation and log capture mechanism
```

### 4.2 Quality Assurance Standards

#### 4.2.1. Code Coverage Requirements

- Thresholds: 85%+ overall line coverage, 95%+ critical components, 100% utilities.
- Track trends, prevent regression.
- Cover all paths, branches, error handling.
- Integrate reports in CI/CD, block merges below thresholds.

```python
# Example Config (e.g., pyproject.toml for pytest-cov)
# [tool.coverage.run]
# branch = true
# source = ["src"]
# [tool.coverage.report]
# fail_under = 85
# show_missing = true
# # Configure path-specific thresholds if tool supports it
```

#### 4.2.2. Static Analysis Rules

- Configure linters (flake8, pylint) and analyzers (mypy, bandit) with strict rules.
- Enforce style, find bugs, identify security/performance issues.
- Create project-specific custom rules.
- Integrate into pre-commit hooks and CI/CD.
- Maintain a "zero warnings" policy (treat warnings as errors).

```python
# Example pre-commit hook config (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
# - repo: [https://github.com/pycqa/flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8)
#   rev: ...
#   hooks:
#   - id: flake8
#     additional_dependencies: [flake8-bugbear, flake8-comprehensions, ...]
# - repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy)
#   rev: ...
#   hooks:
#   - id: mypy
```

#### 4.2.3. Contract Testing Framework

- Define explicit contracts for service interfaces (request/response formats, errors, performance, versions).
- Implement consumer-driven contract tests (e.g., using Pact).
- Maintain a contract registry.
- Automate verification in CI/CD, alert on violations.

```python
# Example (Conceptual using Pact)
# Consumer Side: Define expectations, generate pact file.
# Provider Side: Verify pact file against provider implementation.
# CI: Publish pacts, trigger provider verification.
```

#### 4.2.4. Mutation Testing Guidelines

- Apply systematic code mutations (modify operators, boundaries, logic) to test test effectiveness.
- Establish mutation score thresholds (e.g., 80%+ overall, 90%+ critical).
- Integrate periodically into CI/CD or on significant changes.
- Review and address surviving mutants.
- Focus on high-value targets (business logic, security, error handling).

```python
# Example (Using mutmut)
# Run: mutmut run
# Check results: mutmut results
# Aim for high killed mutant score. Add tests for surviving mutants.
```

#### 4.2.5. Property-Based Testing Framework

- Define invariant properties the code must satisfy (reversibility, mathematical laws, business rules).
- Use libraries like Hypothesis to generate diverse test inputs automatically.
- Define explicit property assertions focusing on "what" not "how".
- Incorporate failure analysis and add specific regressions for found issues.

```python
# Example (Using Hypothesis)
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_idempotence(values):
    """PROPERTY: Sorting an already sorted list produces the same result."""
    once = sorted(values)
    twice = sorted(once)
    assert once == twice
```

### 4.3 Security and Resilience

#### 4.3.1. Security Testing Guidelines

- Apply multi-level security testing (SAST, DAST, IAST, dependency scanning).
- Test against standards (OWASP Top 10, CWE/SANS Top 25).
- Implement specific tests for common vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, data exposure, XXE, SSRF, misconfigs).
- Incorporate into CI/CD, block on critical findings, track security debt.

```python
# Example
def test_sql_injection_prevention():
    """Verify protection against SQL injection attacks using known vectors."""
    # Arrange: Define attack vectors
    # Act/Assert: Test vulnerable endpoints with attack vectors, ensure no data leak/unintended action.
    pass # Use security testing tools/frameworks where possible
```

#### 4.3.2. Resilience Testing Framework (Chaos Engineering)

- Design chaos experiments (dependency failures, network issues, resource exhaustion).
- Define steady-state hypotheses and acceptable degradation/recovery.
- Run controlled experiments in production-like environments with monitoring and abort conditions.
- Incorporate findings into architecture and add regression tests.

```python
# Example (Conceptual)
def test_resilience_to_database_failure():
    """Verify system resilience (e.g., fallback to cache) when DB is unavailable."""
    # Arrange: Define steady state check
    # Act: Simulate DB failure (using chaos tooling or mocks)
    # Assert: Verify system behavior (e.g., reads work from cache, writes fail gracefully)
    # Act: Restore DB connection
    # Assert: Verify system recovers to steady state within RTO.
```

### 4.4 Documentation and Integration

#### 4.4.1. Documentation Testing

- Test all code examples in documentation (extract and execute).
- Validate API documentation completeness against actual implementation.
- Test user journeys (tutorials, setup instructions).
- Automate doc tests in CI/CD, flag documentation drift.

```python
# Example (Using doctest or custom script)
# Extract code blocks from Markdown/RestructuredText.
# Execute each block and check output against expected results if specified.
```

#### 4.4.2. Integration Testing Patterns

- Define integration boundaries explicitly.
- Use appropriate test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies) or real instances strategically.
- Implement end-to-end test scenarios for key user journeys/workflows.
- Manage test environments effectively (containerization, state reset, parallelization).

```python
# Example
def test_user_registration_end_to_end():
    """Verify the complete user registration process across all components."""
    # Arrange: Setup necessary services (API, DB, Email service mock/test mode)
    # Act: Perform registration steps via API calls
    # Assert: Verify intermediate steps (e.g., email sent) and final state (e.g., user in DB, login works).
```

#### 4.4.3. Testability Guidelines

- Design for testability (dependency injection, separation of concerns, avoid global state, pure functions).
- Create testability interfaces (time/filesystem/network abstractions, randomness control).
- Implement testing hooks (instrumentation, state inspection).
- Include testability in code reviews, refactor hard-to-test code.

```python
# Example: Use Dependency Injection
class TestableService:
    # Inject dependencies instead of creating them internally
    def __init__(self, db_client, email_notifier):
        self.db_client = db_client
        self.email_notifier = email_notifier
    # ... methods using injected dependencies ...

# In tests, inject mock/stub implementations
mock_db = MockDbClient()
mock_email = MockEmailNotifier()
service = TestableService(mock_db, mock_email)
# Test service logic...
```

_(This section provides context; detailed implementation is covered in Coding and Testing standards sections.)_

---

## 6. Repository Structure for LLM Code Agents

Designing a repository optimized for LLM-driven code agents involves establishing a structured, maintainable, and secure environment that facilitates high-quality code generation and adherence to established standards.

### 6.1. Root-Level Files and Directories

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Outlines guidelines for contributing to the project, including code standards, branching strategies, and pull request procedures
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Defines expected behavior for contributors to foster an inclusive and respectful community
- **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the project's licensing information
- **`FILE_TREE.md`**: **CRITICAL** - Maintains an up-to-date file structure overview of the project. This file must be kept current whenever the repository structure changes to ensure AI agents can properly navigate the codebase.
- **`docs/`**: Contains detailed documentation, such as architecture overviews, API references, and style guides
- **`src/`**: Houses the main source code, organized by feature or module
- **`tests/`**: Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, mirroring the structure of the `src/` directory
- **`scripts/`**: Contains utility scripts for tasks like setup, deployment, and maintenance
- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production)
- **`.github/`**: Includes GitHub-specific files, such as issue templates and workflows
- **`.llmconfig/`**: Dedicated directory for LLM agent configurations and rules

### 6.2. LLM Agent Configuration (`.llmconfig/`)

**IMPORTANT:** All LLM-specific configurations, prompts, and context files MUST be stored in the `.llmconfig/` directory rather than in other locations such as project root. This ensures consistent AI agent behavior and makes prompt engineering maintainable.

The `.llmconfig/` directory should contain:

- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Primary configuration file for Claude AI, containing general instructions
- **`agent-rules.md`**: Defines coding standards and best practices for the LLM agent to follow
- **`prompt-templates/`**: Contains reusable prompt templates to guide the LLM's behavior
- **`context/`**: Includes files that provide context to the LLM, such as sample inputs/outputs and domain-specific information
- **`examples/`**: Contains exemplary interactions or code snippets for few-shot learning
- **`system-prompts/`**: Holds system-level instructions for different AI agents

This structured approach ensures that all prompt engineering work is centralized, versioned, and properly maintained alongside the codebase.

### 6.3. Maintaining FILE_TREE.md

**CRITICAL:** Whenever the repository structure changes (adding, removing, or moving files and directories), the `FILE_TREE.md` document must be updated accordingly. This file serves as a map of the codebase for LLM agents and is essential for their ability to:

1. Efficiently navigate the project structure
2. Understand relationships between components
3. Identify relevant files when implementing new features or fixing bugs
4. Maintain a mental model of the overall architecture

The `FILE_TREE.md` should:

- Provide a hierarchical representation of the repository's file structure
- Include brief descriptions for key directories and files
- Highlight important files that define core functionality
- Be automatically updated by scripts when possible, or manually updated after structural changes
- Be referenced in commit messages when updated ("Update FILE_TREE.md to reflect new module structure")

### 6.4. Configuration and Tooling

#### 6.4.1. Linters and Formatters

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use ESLint and Prettier with a shared configuration to enforce code style and formatting
- **Python**: Employ Flake8 and Black for linting and formatting, respectively
- **Go**: Utilize `go fmt` and `golint` to maintain code consistency

#### 6.4.2. Type Checking

- **TypeScript**: Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` to enforce rigorous type checking
- **Python**: Incorporate type hints and use tools like `mypy` for static type analysis

#### 6.4.3. Testing Frameworks

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Implement Jest for unit and integration testing
- **Python**: Use Pytest to write and manage tests
- **Go**: Leverage the built-in `testing` package for writing tests

#### 6.4.4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **GitHub Actions**: Set up workflows to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use tools like `pre-commit` to run linters and tests before commits are made

### 6.5. Coding Standards and Best Practices

#### 6.5.1. Naming Conventions

- **Variables and Functions**: Use `camelCase` for naming
- **Classes and Types**: Adopt `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

#### 6.5.2. Code Structure

- **Modularity**: Design code in small, reusable modules or functions
- **Single Responsibility**: Ensure each module or function has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings or comments to explain complex logic and usage

### 6.6. Security and Compliance

- **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `pip-audit`
- **Secrets Management**: Store secrets and sensitive information securely, avoiding hardcoding them in the codebase
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect resources

### 6.7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, focusing on critical and complex parts of the codebase
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members

### 6.8. Documentation and Communication

- **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger or JSDoc to generate and maintain API documentation
- **Changelog**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to document significant changes and updates
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Include diagrams to visualize system architecture and data flow
- **FILE_TREE.md**: Keep this file updated with each structural change to the repository (this is a critical requirement for LLM agents)

    * Apply internationalization/accessibility standards if required by the feature.
    * Design for extensibility.

The code should be robust, efficient, secure, maintainable, directly contribute to the objectives in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, and demonstrate high craftsmanship adhering to all project standards outlined in `CLAUDE.md`.

Note: This is a template example. For project use, store actual prompt templates in the `.llmconfig/prompt-templates/` directory.

### Master Prompt for Test Suite Generation

```
Generate a comprehensive test suite for the provided code ([link/path to code file(s)]).

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** Before starting, review the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` file located in the repository root. Ensure the tests you generate verify that the code behaves according to the overall project vision, current phase objectives, and core principles outlined there. Test scenarios should reflect the target audience's usage patterns and respect defined non-goals.

Follow the project's Testing Manifesto (detailed in CLAUDE.md):

1.  **Core Testing Principles:**
    * Hypothesis tests validating core behaviors and expectations relevant to the project goals.
    * Regression tests covering known edge cases or previously fixed bugs.
    * Benchmark tests for performance-critical sections (if applicable, aligning with principles in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`).
    * Consider inputs for fuzzing/edge case discovery (if applicable).
    * Ensure code generates structured logs if it's an agent/process.

2.  **Quality Assurance:**
    * Aim for high code coverage (85%+ general, 95%+ critical).
    * Ensure code passes static analysis (flake8, mypy).
    * Implement contract tests if interacting with defined interfaces.
    * Consider property-based tests (using Hypothesis) for functions with clear invariants.

3.  **Security and Resilience:**
    * Include security tests relevant to project constraints and potential risks.
    * Add resilience tests if the code handles external dependencies or failure modes mentioned as constraints/principles.

4.  **Documentation and Integration:**
    * Create integration tests for interactions between components/modules if applicable to the current objectives.
    * Ensure tests are clear and serve as documentation.

For each test:
* Use descriptive names (`test_feature_scenario_expected_outcome`).
* Include clear docstrings explaining the test's purpose and its relevance to project goals if not obvious.
* Arrange preconditions, Act by calling the code, Assert expected outcomes.
* Use fixtures (e.g., pytest fixtures) for setup/teardown where appropriate.
* Categorize tests appropriately (unit, integration, etc. - potentially via markers).

The test suite should be maintainable, provide fast feedback, and verify the code's correctness, robustness, and alignment with the requirements and goals specified in both `CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

Note: This is a template example. For project use, store actual prompt templates in the `.llmconfig/prompt-templates/` directory.

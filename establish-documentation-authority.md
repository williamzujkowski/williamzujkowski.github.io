# Documentation Authority & Strategic Next Steps Mission

## OBJECTIVE
Establish CLAUDE.md and project documentation as the single source of truth for williamzujkowski.github.io, review maintenance framework, and identify strategic next steps for continuous improvement based on completed enhancements.

## CONTEXT
Following successful completion of:
- ✅ Content compliance (100% NDA compliant, politically neutral)
- ✅ Citation enhancement (90%+ coverage with academic sources)
- ✅ Pages transformation (personal storytelling achieved)
- ✅ UI/UX optimization (responsive, accessible, performant)

Now need to consolidate documentation authority and establish sustainable improvement processes.

## PHASE 1: DOCUMENTATION AUTHORITY ESTABLISHMENT

### 1.1 CLAUDE.md as Primary Authority
```markdown
# Update CLAUDE.md header with:
---
STATUS: AUTHORITATIVE
VERSION: 3.0.0
LAST_AUDIT: 2025-09-21
COMPLIANCE: 100%
CITATIONS: 90%+
UI_UX: OPTIMIZED
---

# AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTATION NOTICE
This file (CLAUDE.md) serves as the single source of truth for:
- Content standards and compliance boundaries
- Technical implementation guidelines
- Blog post requirements and style
- UI/UX standards and responsive design
- Citation and research requirements

All development, content creation, and maintenance MUST reference this document.
Last comprehensive audit: 2025-09-21
Next scheduled review: 2025-12-21
```

### 1.2 Documentation Hierarchy
```yaml
Primary (Authoritative):
  - CLAUDE.md: Master reference for all standards
  - MANIFEST.json: System inventory and file registry
  - .claude-rules.json: Enforcement rules

Secondary (Supporting):

  - docs/GUIDES/: How-to documentation
  - docs/ENFORCEMENT.md: Mandatory rules
  - content-review-instructions.md: Review standards

Generated (Reference):
  - reports/: Audit and compliance reports
  - docs/STANDARDS/: Implementation checklists
```

### 1.3 Cross-Reference Updates
Ensure all documentation points to CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# In README.md:
> **For Development Standards**: See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Authoritative source
> **For Content Guidelines**: See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#content-standards)

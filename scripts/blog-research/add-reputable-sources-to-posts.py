### Security Research Insights

The academic community has identified several critical areas for eBPF security:

- **Verifier Bypasses**: Research shows that the eBPF verifier, while robust, has had vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31440, CVE-2021-33624)
- **JIT Compiler Security**: Studies highlight the importance of secure JIT compilation for eBPF programs
- **Kernel Memory Access**: Research emphasizes careful handling of kernel memory access from eBPF programs

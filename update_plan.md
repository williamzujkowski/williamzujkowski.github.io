### üñåÔ∏è Color Palette Enhancement with OKLCH

To improve the visual appeal and accessibility of your site, consider adopting the OKLCH color model. This model offers perceptual uniformity, ensuring consistent contrast and readability across different devices and lighting conditions. Here's a suggested color palette:

```css
:root {
  --clr-background-light: oklch(0.98 0.02 270);
  --clr-background-dark: oklch(0.12 0.03 270);
  --clr-text-light: oklch(0.1 0.02 90);
  --clr-text-dark: oklch(0.9 0.02 90);
  --clr-link-light: oklch(0.85 0.2 240);
  --clr-link-dark: oklch(0.85 0.2 240);
}
```

Implement these colors in your Tailwind configuration to ensure consistency across your site.

### üì± Mobile Styling and Readability

Your blog's mobile experience is commendable. To maintain and enhance this:

1. **Typography:**

   * Use responsive font sizes and line heights to ensure readability on all devices.
   * Consider using a modular scale for font sizes to maintain visual hierarchy.

2. **Images and Charts:**

   * Ensure images and charts are responsive. Use classes like `max-w-full` and `h-auto` to make them scale appropriately on different screen sizes.
   * Implement lazy loading for images to improve page load times.

3. **Layout:**

   * Utilize Tailwind's grid and flex utilities to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
   * Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile users.
